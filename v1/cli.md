# AWS CDK Toolkit \(`cdk` command\)<a name="cli"></a>

The AWS CDK Toolkit, the CLI command `cdk`, is the primary tool for interacting with your AWS CDK app\. It executes your app, interrogates the application model you defined, and produces and deploys the AWS CloudFormation templates generated by the AWS CDK\. It also provides other features useful for creating and working with AWS CDK projects\. This topic contains information about common use cases of the CDK Toolkit\.

The AWS CDK Toolkit is installed with the Node Package Manager\. In most cases, we recommend installing it globally\.

```
npm install -g aws-cdk@1.x         # install latest 1.x version
npm install -g aws-cdk@X.YY.Z      # install specific version
```

You may also use CDK Toolkit v2\.x with CDK v1\.x projects\. An exception is that CDK Toolkit v2 creates CDK v2 projects\. You cannot create CDK v1 projects while CDK Toolkit v2\.x is installed globally; uninstall the global version and use npx to run the latest 1\.x release\.

```
npx aws-cdk@1.x init app --language typescript
```

**Tip**  
If you regularly work with multiple versions of the AWS CDK, you may want to install a matching version of the AWS CDK Toolkit in individual CDK projects\. TypeScript and JavaScript projects have a local copy of the CDK Toolkit already\. For other languages, omit `-g` from the `npm install` command\. Then use `npx aws-cdk` to invoke cdk; this will run the local version if one exists, falling back to a global version if not\.

## Toolkit commands<a name="cli-commands"></a>

All CDK Toolkit commands start with `cdk`, which is followed by a subcommand \(`list`, `synthesize`, `deploy`, etc\.\)\. Some subcommands have a shorter version \(`ls`, `synth`, etc\.\) that is equivalent\. Options and arguments follow the subcommand in any order\. The available commands are summarized here\.


| Command | Function | 
| --- | --- | 
| `cdk list` \(`ls`\) | Lists the stacks in the app | 
| `cdk synthesize` \(`synth`\) | Synthesizes and prints the CloudFormation template for the specified stack\(s\) | 
| `cdk bootstrap` | Deploys the CDK Toolkit staging stack; see [Bootstrapping](bootstrapping.md) | 
| `cdk deploy` | Deploys the specified stack\(s\) | 
| `cdk destroy` | Destroys the specified stack\(s\) | 
| `cdk diff` | Compares the specified stack with the deployed stack or a local CloudFormation template | 
| `cdk metadata` | Displays metadata about the specified stack | 
| `cdk init` | Creates a new CDK project in the current directory from a specified template | 
| `cdk context` | Manages cached context values | 
| `cdk docs` \(`doc`\) | Opens the CDK API reference in your browser | 
| `cdk doctor` | Checks your CDK project for potential problems | 

For the options available for each command, see [Toolkit reference](#cli-ref) or [Built\-in help](#cli-help)\.

## Specifying options and their values<a name="cli-options"></a>

Command line options begin with two hyphens \(`--`\)\. Some frequently\-used options have single\-letter synonyms that begin with a single hyphen \(for example, `--app` has a synonym `-a`\)\. The order of options in an AWS CDK Toolkit command is not important\.

All options accept a value, which must follow the option name\. The value may be separated from the name by whitespace or by an equals sign `=`\. The following two options are equivalent

```
--toolkit-stack-name MyBootstrapStack
--toolkit-stack-name=MyBootstrapStack
```

Some options are flags \(Booleans\)\. You may specify `true` or `false` as their value\. If you do not provide a value, the value is taken to be `true`\. You may also prefix the option name with `no-` to imply `false`\.

```
# sets staging flag to true
--staging
--staging=true
--staging true

# sets staging flag to false
--no-staging
--staging=false
--staging false
```

A few options, namely `--context`, `--parameters`, `--plugin`, `--tags`, and `--trust`, may be specified more than once to specify multiple values\. These are noted as having `[array]` type in the CDK Toolkit help\. For example:

```
cdk bootstrap --tags costCenter=0123 --tags responsibleParty=jdoe
```

## Built\-in help<a name="cli-help"></a>

The AWS CDK Toolkit has integrated help\. You can see general help about the utility and a list of the provided subcommands by issuing:

```
cdk --help
```

To see help for a particular subcommand, for example `deploy`, specify it before the `--help` flag\.

```
cdk deploy --help
```

Issue `cdk version` to display the version of the AWS CDK Toolkit\. Provide this information when requesting support\.

## Version reporting<a name="version_reporting"></a>

To gain insight into how the AWS CDK is used, the constructs used by AWS CDK applications are collected and reported by using a resource identified as `AWS::CDK::Metadata`\. This resource is added to AWS CloudFormation templates, and can easily be reviewed\. This information can also be used by AWS to identify stacks using a construct with known security or reliability issues, and to contact their users with important information\.

**Note**  
Prior to version 1\.93\.0, the AWS CDK reported the names and versions of the modules loaded during synthesis, rather than the constructs used in the stack\.

By default, the AWS CDK reports the use of constructs in the following NPM modules that are used in the stack:
+ AWS CDK core module
+ AWS Construct Library modules
+ AWS Solutions Constructs module
+ AWS Render Farm Deployment Kit module

The `AWS::CDK::Metadata` resource looks something like the following\.

```
CDKMetadata:
  Type: "AWS::CDK::Metadata"
  Properties:
    Analytics: "v2:deflate64:H4sIAND9SGAAAzXKSw5AMBAA0L1b2PdzBYnEAdio3RglglY60zQi7u6TWL/XKmNUlxeQSOKwaPTBqrNhwEWU3hGHiCzK0dWWfAxoL/Fd8mvk+QkS/0X6BdjnCdgmOOQKWz+AqqLDt2Y3YMnLYWwAAAA="
```

The `Analytics` property is a gzipped, base64\-encoded, prefix\-encoded list of the constructs present in the stack\.

To opt out of version reporting, use one of the following methods:
+ Use the cdk command with the \-\-no\-version\-reporting argument to opt out for a single command\.

  ```
  cdk --no-version-reporting synth
  ```

  Remember, the AWS CDK Toolkit synthesizes fresh templates before deploying, so you should also add `--no-version-reporting` to `cdk deploy` commands\.
+ Set versionReporting to **false** in `./cdk.json` or `~/.cdk.json`\. This opts out unless you opt in by specifying `--version-reporting` on an individual command\.

  ```
  {
    "app": "...",
    "versionReporting": false
  }
  ```

## Specifying credentials and region<a name="cli-environment"></a>

The CDK Toolkit needs to know your AWS account credentials and the AWS region into which you are deploying, not only for deployment operations but also to retrieve context values during synthesis\. Together, your account and region make up the *environment*\.

**Important**  
We strongly recommend against using your main AWS account for day\-to\-day tasks\. Instead, create a user in IAM and use its credentials with the CDK\.

Credentials and region may be specified using environment variables or in configuration files\. These are the same variables and files used by other AWS tools such as the AWS CLI and the various AWS SDKs\. The CDK Toolkit looks for this information in the following order\.
+ The `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variables\. Always specify all three variables, not just one or two\.
+ A specific profile defined in the standard AWS `config` and `credentials` files, and specified using the `--profile` option on `cdk` commands\.
+ The `[default]` section of the standard AWS `config` and `credentials` files\.

**Note**  
The standard AWS `config` and `credentials` files are located at `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` \(macOS/Linux\) or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config` and `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials` \(Windows\)\.

The environment specified in your AWS CDK app using the stack's `env` property is used during synthesis to generate an environment\-specific AWS CloudFormation template and during deployment to override the account or region specified by one of the above methods\. For more information, see [Environments](environments.md)\.

If you have the AWS CLI installed, the easiest way to configure your account credentials and a default region is to issue the following command:

```
aws configure
```

Provide your AWS access key ID, secret access key, and default region when prompted\. These values are written to the `[default]` section of the `config` and `credentials` files\.

If you don't have the AWS CLI installed, you can manually create or edit the `config` and `credentials` files to contain default credentials and a default region, in the following format\.
+ In `~/.aws/config` or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config`

  ```
  [default]
  region=us-west-2
  ```
+ In `~/.aws/credentials` or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials`

  ```
  [default]
  aws_access_key_id=AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
  aws_secret_access_key=je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
  ```

Besides specifying AWS credentials and a region in the `[default]` section, you can also add one or more `[profile NAME]` sections, where *NAME* is the name of the profile\.
+ In `~/.aws/config` or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config`

  ```
  [profile test]
  region=us-east-1
  
  [profile prod]
  region=us-west-1
  ```
+ In `~/.aws/credentials` or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials`

  ```
  [profile test]
  aws_access_key_id=AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
  aws_secret_access_key=je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
  
  [profile test]
  aws_access_key_id=AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
  aws_secret_access_key=je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
  ```

Always add named profiles to both the `config` and `credentials` files\. The AWS CDK Toolkit does not fall back to using the region in the `[default]` section when the specified named profile is not found in the `config` file, as some other AWS tools do\.

**Important**  
Do not name a profile `default`: that is, do not use a `[profile default]` section in either `config` or `credentials`\.

**Note**  
Although the AWS CDK uses credentials from the same sources files as other AWS tools and SDKs, including the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html), it may behave slightly differently from these tools\. See [Setting credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials.html) for complete details on setting up credentials for the AWS SDK for JavaScript, which the AWS CDK uses under the hood\.

You may optionally use the `--role-arn` \(or `-r`\) option to specify the ARN of an IAM role that should be used for deployment\. This role must be assumable by the AWS account being used\.

## Specifying the app command<a name="cli-app-command"></a>

Many features of the CDK Toolkit require one or more AWS CloudFormation templates be synthesized, which in turn requires running your application\. Since the AWS CDK supports programs written in a variety of languages, it uses a configuration option to specify the exact command necessary to run your app\. This option can be specified in two ways\.

First, and most commonly, it can be specified using the `app` key inside the file `cdk.json`, which is in the main directory of your AWS CDK project\. The CDK Toolkit provides an appropriate command when creating a new project with `cdk init`\. Here is the `cdk.json` from a fresh TypeScript project, for instance\.

```
{
  "app": "npx ts-node bin/hello-cdk.ts"
}
```

The CDK Toolkit looks for `cdk.json` in the current working directory when attempting to run your app, so you might keep a shell open in your project's main directory for issuing CDK Toolkit commands\.

The CDK Toolkit also looks for the app key in `~/.cdk.json` \(that is, in your home directory\) if it can't find it in `./cdk.json`\. Adding the app command here can be useful if you usually work with CDK code in the same language\.

If you are in some other directory, or if you want to run your app via a command other than the one in `cdk.json`, you can use the `--app` \(or `-a`\) option to specify it\.

```
cdk --app "npx ts-node bin/hello-cdk.ts" ls
```

When deploying, you may also specify a directory containing synthesized cloud assemblies, such as `cdk.out`, as the value of \-\-app\. The specified stacks are deployed from this directory; the app is not synthesized\.

## Specifying stacks<a name="cli-stacks"></a>

Many CDK Toolkit commands \(for example, `cdk deploy`\) work on stacks defined in your app\. If your app contains only one stack, the CDK Toolkit assumes you mean that one if you don't specify a stack explicitly\.

Otherwise, you must specify the stack or stacks you want to work with\. You can do this by specifying the desired stacks by ID individually on the command line\. Recall that the ID is the value specified by the second argument when you instantiate the stack\.

```
cdk synth PipelineStack LambdaStack
```

You may also use wildcards to specify IDs that match a pattern\.
+ `?` matches any single character
+ `*` matches any number of characters \(`*` alone matches all stacks\)
+ `**` matches everything in a hierarchy

You may also use the \-\-all option to specify all stacks\.

If your app uses [CDK Pipelines](cdk_pipeline.md), the CDK Toolkit understands your stacks and stages as a hierarchy, and the \-\-all option and the `*` wildcard only match top\-level stacks\. To match all the stacks, use `**`\. Also use `**` to indicate all the stacks under a particular hierarchy\.

When using wildcards, enclose the pattern in quotes, or escape the wildcards with `\`\. If you don't, your shell may try to expand the pattern to the names of files in the current directory\. At best, this won't do what you expect; at worst, you could deploy stacks you didn't intend to\. This isn't strictly necessary on Windows because `cmd.exe` does not expand wildcards, but is good practice nonetheless\.

```
cdk synth "*Stack"    # PipelineStack, LambdaStack, etc.
cdk synth 'Stack?'    # StackA, StackB, Stack1, etc.
cdk synth \*          # All stacks in the app, or all top-level stacks in a CDK Pipelines app
cdk synth '**'        # All stacks in a CDK Pipelines app
cdk synth 'PipelineStack/Prod/**'   # All stacks in Prod stage in a CDK Pipelines app
```

**Note**  
The order in which you specify the stacks is not necessarily the order in which they will be processed\. The AWS CDK Toolkit takes into account dependencies between stacks when deciding the order in which to process them\. For example, if one stack uses a value produced by another \(such as the ARN of a resource defined in the second stack\), the second stack is synthesized before the first one because of this dependency\. You can add dependencies between stacks manually using the stack's [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/@aws-cdk_core.Stack.html#addwbrdependencytarget-reason](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/@aws-cdk_core.Stack.html#addwbrdependencytarget-reason) method\.

## Bootstrapping your AWS environment<a name="cli-bootstrap"></a>

Deploying stacks that contain [assets](assets.md), synthesize to large templates, or use [CDK Pipelines](cdk_pipeline.md) require special dedicated AWS CDK resources to be provisioned\. The `cdk bootstrap` command creates the necessary resources for you\. You only need to bootstrap if you are deploying a stack that requires these dedicated resources\. See [Bootstrapping](bootstrapping.md) for details\.

```
cdk bootstrap
```

If issued with no arguments, as shown here, the `cdk bootstrap` command synthesizes the current app and bootstraps the environments its stacks will be deployed to\. If the app contains environment\-agnostic stacks, which do not explicitly specify an environment so they can be deployed anywhere, the default account and region are bootstrapped, or the environment specified using `--profile`\.

Outside of an app, you must explicitly specify the environment to be bootstrapped\. You may also do so to bootstrap an environment that's not specified in your app or local AWS profile\. Credentials must be configured \(e\.g\. in `~/.aws/credentials`\) for the specified account and region\. You may specify a profile that contains the required credentials\.

```
cdk bootstrap ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION # e.g.
cdk bootstrap 1111111111/us-east-1
cdk bootstrap --profile test 1111111111/us-east-1
```

**Important**  
Each environment \(account/region combination\) to which you deploy such a stack must be bootstrapped separately\.

You may incur AWS charges for what the AWS CDK stores in the bootstrapped resources\. Additionally, if you use `-bootstrap-customer-key`, a Customer Master Key \(CMK\) will be created, which also incurs charges per environment\.

**Note**  
Older versions of the modern template created a Customer Master Key by default\. To avoid charges, re\-bootstrap using `--no-bootstrap-customer-key`\. 

The CDK Toolkit supports two bootstrap templates: the modern template and the legacy template\. The legacy template is the default, but the modern template is required by CDK Pipelines\. For more information, see [Bootstrapping](bootstrapping.md)\.

**Important**  
The modern bootstrap template effectively grants the permissions implied by the `--cloudformation-execution-policies` to any AWS account in the `--trust` list, which by default will extend permissions to read and write to any resource in the bootstrapped account\. Make sure to [configure the bootstrapping stack](bootstrapping.md#bootstrapping-customizing) with policies and trusted accounts you are comfortable with\.

## Creating a new app<a name="cli-init"></a>

To create a new app, create a directory for it, then, inside the directory, issue `cdk init`\.

```
mkdir my-cdk-app
cd my-cdk-app
cdk init TEMPLATE --language LANGUAGE
```

**Tip**  
If you have installed CDK Toolkit v2 globally, cdk init creates CDK v2 projects\. To avoid this, see [CDK Toolkit v2 compatibility](work-with-cdk-v2.md#work-with-cdk-v2-cli)\.

The supported languages \(*LANGUAGE*\) are:


| Code | Language | 
| --- | --- | 
| `typescript` | TypeScript | 
| `javascript` | JavaScript | 
| `python` | Python | 
| `java` | Java | 
| `csharp` | C\# | 

*TEMPLATE* is an optional template\. If the desired template is *app*, the default, you may omit it\. The available templates are:


| Template | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| `app` \(default\) |  Creates an empty AWS CDK app\.  | 
| `sample-app` |  Creates an AWS CDK app with a stack containing an Amazon SQS queue and an Amazon SNS topic\.  | 

The templates use the name of the project folder to generate names for files and classes inside your new app\.

## Listing stacks<a name="cli-list"></a>

To see a list of the IDs of the stacks in your AWS CDK application, enter one of the following equivalent commands:

```
cdk list
cdk ls
```

If your application contains [CDK Pipelines](cdk_pipeline.md) stacks, the CDK Toolkit displays stack names as paths according to their location in the pipeline hierarchy \(e\.g\., `PipelineStack`, `PipelineStack/Prod`, `PipelineStack/Prod/MyService`, etc\)\.

If your app contains many stacks, you can specify full or partial stack IDs of the stacks to be listed; see [Specifying stacks](#cli-stacks)\.

Add the `--long` flag to see more information about the stacks, including the stack names and their environments \(AWS account and region\)\.

## Synthesizing stacks<a name="cli-synth"></a>

The `cdk synthesize` command \(almost always abbreviated `synth`\) synthesizes a stack defined in your app into a CloudFormation template\.

```
cdk synth         # if app contains only one stack
cdk synth MyStack
cdk synth Stack1 Stack2
cdk synth "*"     # all stacks in app
```

**Note**  
The CDK Toolkit actually runs your app and synthesizes fresh templates before most operations \(e\.g\. when deploying or comparing stacks\)\. These templates are stored by default in the `cdk.out` directory\. The `cdk synth` command simply prints the generated templates for the specified stack\(s\)\.

See `cdk synth --help` for all available options\. A few of the most\-frequently\-used options are covered below\.

### Specifying context values<a name="w318aac33b7c35c11"></a>

Use the `--context` or `-c` option to pass [runtime context](context.md) values to your CDK app\.

```
# specify a single context value
cdk synth --context key=value MyStack

# specify multiple context values (any number)
cdk synth --context key1=value1 --context key2=value2 MyStack
```

When deploying multiple stacks, the specified context values are normally passed to all of them\. If you wish, you may specify different values for each stack by prefixing the stack name to the context value\.

```
# different context values for each stack
cdk synth --context Stack1:key=value Stack2:key=value Stack1 Stack2
```

### Specifying display format<a name="w318aac33b7c35c13"></a>

By default, the synthesized template is displayed in YAML format\. Add the `--json` flag to display it in JSON format instead\.

```
cdk synth --json MyStack
```

### Specifying output directory<a name="w318aac33b7c35c15"></a>

Add the `--output` \(`-o`\) option to write the synthesized templates to a directory other than `cdk.out`\.

```
cdk synth --output=~/templates
```

## Deploying stacks<a name="cli-deploy"></a>

The `cdk deploy` subcommand deploys the specified stack\(s\) to your AWS account\.

```
cdk deploy        # if app contains only one stack
cdk deploy MyStack
cdk deploy Stack1 Stack2
cdk deploy "*"    # all stacks in app
```

**Note**  
The CDK Toolkit runs your app and synthesizes fresh AWS CloudFormation templates before deploying anything\. Therefore, most command line options you can use with `cdk synth` \(for example, `--context`\) can also be used with `cdk deploy`\.

See `cdk deploy --help` for all available options\. A few of the most useful options are covered below\.

### Skipping synthesis<a name="cli-deploy-nosynth"></a>

The cdk deploy command normally synthesizes your app's stacks before deploying to make sure the deployment reflects the latest version of your app\. If you know that you haven't made any changes to your code since your last cdk synth, you may suppress the redundant synthesis step when deploying\. Simply specify your project's `cdk.out` directory in the \-\-app option\.

```
cdk deploy --app cdk.out StackOne StackTwo
```

### Disabling rollback<a name="cli-deploy-norollback"></a>

One of AWS CloudFormation's marquee features is its ability to roll back changes so that deployments are atomic—they either succeed or fail as a whole\. The AWS CDK inherits this capability because it synthesizes and deploys AWS CloudFormation templates\. 

Rollback makes sure your resources are in a consistent state at all times, which is vital for production stacks\. However, while you're still developing your infrastructure, some failures are inevitable, and rolling back failed deployments just slows you down\.

For this reason, the CDK Toolkit allows you to disable rollback by adding `--no-rollback` to your `cdk deploy` command\. With this flag, failed deployments are not rolled back\. Instead, resources deployed before the failed resource remain in place, and the next deployment starts with the failed resource\. You'll spend a lot less time waiting for deployments and a lot more time developing your infrastructure\.

### Hot swapping<a name="cli-deploy-hotswap"></a>

Use the `--hotswap` flag with `cdk deploy` to attempt to update your AWS resources directly instead of generating a AWS CloudFormation changeset and deploying it\. Deployment falls back to AWS CloudFormation deployment if hot swapping is not possible\.

Currently hot swapping supports Lambda functions, Step Functions state machines, and Amazon ECS container images\. The `--hotswap` flag also disables rollback \(i\.e\., implies `--no-rollback`\)\.

**Important**  
Hot\-swapping is not recommended for production deployments\.

### Watch mode<a name="cli-deploy-watch"></a>

The CDK Toolkit's watch mode \( cdk deploy \-\-watch, or cdk watch for short\) continuously monitors your CDK app's source files and assets for changes and immediately performs a deployment of the specified stacks when a change is detected\.

By default, these deployments use the `--hotswap` flag, which fast\-tracks deployment of changes to Lambda functions, and falls back to deploying through AWS CloudFormation if you have changed infrastructure configuration\. To have `cdk watch` always perform full AWS CloudFormation deployments, add the `--no-hotswap` flag to `cdk watch`\.

Any changes made while `cdk watch` is already performing a deployment will be combined into a single deployment, which will begin as soon as the in\-progress deployment is complete\.

Watch mode uses the `"watch"` key in the project's `cdk.json` to determine which files to monitor\. By default, these files are your application files and assets, but this can be changed by modifying the `"include"` and `"exclude"` entries in the `"watch"` key\. The following `cdk.json` file shows an example of these entries\.

```
{
  "app": "mvn -e -q compile exec:java",
  "watch": {
    "include": "src/main/**",
    "exclude": "target/*"
  }
}
```

`cdk watch` executes the `"build"` command from `cdk.json` to build your app before synthesis\. If your deployment requires any commands to build or package your Lambda code \(or anything else that's not in your CDK app proper\), add it here\.

Git\-style wildcards, both `*` and `**`, can be used in the `"watch"` and `"build"` keys\. Each path is interpreted relative to the parent directory of `cdk.json`\. The default value of `include` is `**/*`, meaning all files and directories in the project root directory\. `exclude` is optional\.

**Important**  
Watch mode is not recommended for production deployments\.

### Specifying AWS CloudFormation parameters<a name="w318aac33b7c37c19"></a>

The AWS CDK Toolkit supports specifying AWS CloudFormation [parameters](parameters.md) at deployment\. You may provide these on the command line following the `--parameters` flag\.

```
cdk deploy MyStack --parameters uploadBucketName=UploadBucket
```

To define multiple parameters, use multiple `--parameters` flags\.

```
cdk deploy MyStack --parameters uploadBucketName=UpBucket --parameters downloadBucketName=DownBucket
```

If you are deploying multiple stacks, you can specify a different value of each parameter for each stack by prefixing the name of the parameter with the stack name and a colon\. Otherwise, the same value is passed to all stacks\.

```
cdk deploy MyStack YourStack --parameters MyStack:uploadBucketName=UploadBucket --parameters YourStack:uploadBucketName=UpBucket
```

By default, the AWS CDK retains values of parameters from previous deployments and uses them in later deployments if they are not specified explicitly\. Use the `--no-previous-parameters` flag to require all parameters to be specified\.

### Specifying outputs file<a name="w318aac33b7c37c21"></a>

If your stack declares AWS CloudFormation outputs, these are normally displayed on the screen at the conclusion of deployment\. To write them to a file in JSON format, use the `--outputs-file` flag\.

```
cdk deploy --outputs-file outputs.json MyStack
```

### Security\-related changes<a name="cli-security"></a>

To protect you against unintended changes that affect your security posture, the AWS CDK Toolkit prompts you to approve security\-related changes before deploying them\. You can specify the level of change that requires approval:

```
cdk deploy --require-approval LEVEL
```

*LEVEL* can be one of the following:


| Term | Meaning | 
| --- | --- | 
| `never` | Approval is never required | 
| `any-change` | Requires approval on any IAM or security\-group\-related change | 
| `broadening` \(default\) | Requires approval when IAM statements or traffic rules are added; removals don't require approval | 

The setting can also be configured in the `cdk.json` file\.

```
{
  "app": "...",
  "requireApproval": "never"
}
```

## Comparing stacks<a name="cli-diff"></a>

The `cdk diff` command compares the current version of a stack defined in your app with the already\-deployed version, or with a saved AWS CloudFormation template, and displays a list of changes \.
