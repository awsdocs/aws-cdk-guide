# Stacks<a name="stacks"></a>

A [Stack](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_cdk.html#@aws-cdk/cdk.Stack) is an AWS CDK construct that can be deployed into an AWS environment\. The combination of region and account becomes the stack's *environment*, as described in [Environments and Authentication](environments.md)\. Most production apps consist of multiple stacks of resources that are deployed as a single transaction using a resource provisioning service like AWS CloudFormation\. Any resources added directly or indirectly as children of a stack are included in the stack's template as it is synthesized by your AWS CDK program\.

Define an application stack by extending the [Stack](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_cdk.html#@aws-cdk/cdk.Stack) class, as shown in the following example\.

```
import { Stack, StackProps } from '@aws-cdk/cdk'

interface MyStackProps extends StackProps {
    encryptedStorage: boolean;
}

class MyStack extends Stack {
    constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: MyStackProps) {
        super(scope, id, props);

        new MyStorageLayer(this, 'Storage', { encryptedStorage: props.encryptedStorage });
        new MyControlPlane(this, 'CPlane');
        new MyDataPlane(this, 'DPlane');
    }
}
```

And then, add instances of this class to your app:

```
const app = new App();

new MyStack(app, 'NorthAmerica', { env: { region: 'us-east-1' } });
new MyStack(app, 'Europe', { env: { region: 'us-west-2' } });
```
