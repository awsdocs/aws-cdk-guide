# AWS CDK Concepts<a name="concepts"></a>

This topic describes some of the concepts \(the why and how\) behind the AWS CDK\. It also discusses the advantages of the AWS Construct Library over a low\-level CloudFormation Resource\.

AWS CDK apps are composed of building blocks called [constructs](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_cdk.html#construct), which are composed together to form [Stacks](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_cdk.html#@aws-cdk/cdk.Stack) and [Apps](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_cdk.html#app).
