# AWS CDK Tutorial<a name="tutorial"></a>

This topic walks you through creating and deploying an AWS CDK app, from initializing the project to deploying the resulting AWS CloudFormation template\.

## Creating the Project<a name="tutorial_create_directory"></a>

Create a directory for your project with an empty Git repository\.

```
mkdir hello-cdk
cd hello-cdk
```

## Initializing the Project<a name="tutorial_init_project"></a>

Initialize an empty project, where *LANGUAGE* is one of the supported programming languages: **csharp** \(C\#\), **java** \(Java\), or **typescript** \(TypeScript\)\.

```
cdk init --language LANGUAGE
```

## Compiling the Project<a name="tutorial_compile_project"></a>

Compile your program:

------
#### [ C\# ]

Since configured `cdk.json` to run dotnet run, which restores dependencies, builds, and runs your application, run the following command:

```
cdk
```

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

Nothing to compile\.

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

```
npm run build
```

------
#### [ Java ]

```
mvn compile
```

------

## Listing the Stacks in the App<a name="tutorial_list_stacks"></a>

List the stacks in the app\.

```
cdk ls
```

The result is just the name of the stack:

```
HelloCdkStack
```

**Note**  
There is a known issue on Windows with the AWS CDK \.NET environment\. Whenever you use a cdk command, it issues a node warning similar to the following:  

```
(node:27508) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection
(rejection id: 1): Error: EPIPE: broken pipe, write
(node:27508) [DEP0018] DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated.
In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the
Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.
```

You can safely ignore this warning\.

## Adding an Amazon S3 Bucket<a name="tutorial_add_bucket"></a>

What can you do with this app? Nothing\. Since the stack is empty, there's nothing to deploy\. Let's define an Amazon S3 bucket\.

Install the `@aws-cdk/aws-s3` package:

------
#### [ C\# ]

```
dotnet add package Amazon.CDK.AWS.S3
```

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

```
npm install @aws-cdk/aws-s3
```

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

```
npm install @aws-cdk/aws-s3
```

------
#### [ Java ]

Add the following to `pom.xml`, where *CDK\-VERSION* is the version of the AWS CDK:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>software.amazon.awscdk</groupId>
  <artifactId>s3</artifactId>
  <version>CDK-VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

------

Next, define an Amazon S3 bucket in the stack\. Amazon S3 buckets are represented by the [Bucket](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-s3.html#@aws-cdk/aws-s3.Bucket) class:

------
#### [ C\# ]

Create `MyStack.cs`:

```
using Amazon.CDK;
using Amazon.CDK.AWS.S3;

namespace HelloCdk
{
    public class MyStack : Stack
    {
        public MyStack(App scope, string id) : base(scope, id, null)
        {
            new Bucket(this, "MyFirstBucket", new BucketProps
            {
                Versioned = true
            });
        }
    }
}
```

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

In `index.js`:

```
const cdk = require('@aws-cdk/cdk');
const s3 = require('@aws-cdk/aws-s3');

class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
    constructor(scope, id, props) {
        super(scope, id, props);

        new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyFirstBucket', {
            versioned: true
        });
    }
}
```

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

In `lib/hello-cdk-stack.ts`:

```
import cdk = require('@aws-cdk/cdk');
import s3 = require('@aws-cdk/aws-s3');

export class HelloCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
    constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
        super(scope, id, props);

        new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyFirstBucket', {
            versioned: true
        });
    }
}
```

------
#### [ Java ]

In `src/main/java/com/acme/MyStack.java`:

```
package com.acme;

import software.amazon.awscdk.App;
import software.amazon.awscdk.Stack;
import software.amazon.awscdk.StackProps;
import software.amazon.awscdk.services.s3.Bucket;
import software.amazon.awscdk.services.s3.BucketProps;

public class MyStack extends Stack {
    public MyStack(final App scope, final String id) {
        this(scope, id, null);
    }

    public MyStack(final App scope, final String id, final StackProps props) {
        super(scope, id, props);

        new Bucket(this, "MyFirstBucket", BucketProps.builder()
            .withVersioned(true)
            .build());
    }
}
```

------

A few things to notice:
+ [Bucket](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-s3.html#@aws-cdk/aws-s3.Bucket) is a construct\. This means it's initialization signature has **scope**, **id**, and **props**\. In this case, the bucket is an immediate child of **MyStack**\.
+ `MyFirstBucket` is the **logical id** of the bucket construct, not the physical name of the Amazon S3 bucket\. The logical ID is used to uniquely identify resources in your stack across deployments\. See [Logical IDs](logical_ids.md) for information on logical IDs\. To specify a physical name for your bucket, set the [bucketName](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-s3.html#@aws-cdk/aws-s3.BucketProps.bucketName) property when you define your bucket\.
+ Since the bucket's [versioned](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-s3.html#@aws-cdk/aws-s3.versioned) property is `true`, [versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html) is enabled on the bucket\.

Compile your program:

------
#### [ C\# ]

Since configured `cdk.json` to run dotnet run, which restores dependencies, builds, and runs your application, run the following command:

```
cdk
```

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

Nothing to compile\.

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

```
npm run build
```

------
#### [ Java ]

```
mvn compile
```

------

## Synthesizing an AWS CloudFormation Template<a name="tutorial_synth_template"></a>

Synthesize a AWS CloudFormation template for the stack:

```
cdk synth HelloCdkStack
```

**Note**  
Since the AWS CDK app only contains a single stack, you can omit `HelloCdkStack`\.

This command executes the AWS CDK app and synthesize an AWS CloudFormation template for the **HelloCdkStack** stack\. You should see something similar to the following, where *VERSION* is the version of the AWS CDK\.

```
Resources:
  MyFirstBucketB8884501:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
    Metadata:
      aws:cdk:path: HelloCdkStack/MyFirstBucket/Resource
  CDKMetadata:
    Type: AWS::CDK::Metadata
    Properties:
      Modules: "@aws-cdk/aws-codepipeline-api=VERSION,@aws-cdk/aws-events=VERSION,@aws-c\
        dk/aws-iam=VERSION,@aws-cdk/aws-kms=VERSION,@aws-cdk/aws-s3=VERSION,@aws-c\
        dk/aws-s3-notifications=VERSION,@aws-cdk/cdk=VERSION,@aws-cdk/cx-api=VERSION\
        .0,hello-cdk=0.1.0"
```

You can see that the stack contains an **AWS::S3::Bucket** resource with the desired versioning configuration\.

**Note**  
The **AWS::CDK::Metadata** resource was automatically added to your template by the toolkit\. This allows us to learn which libraries were used in your stack\. See [Version Reporting](tools.md#version_reporting) for details, including how to [opt out](tools.md#version_reporting_opt_out)\.

## Deploying the Stack<a name="tutorial_deploy_stack"></a>

Deploy the stack:

```
cdk deploy
```

The deploy command synthesizes an AWS CloudFormation template from the stack and then invokes the AWS CloudFormation create/update API to deploy it into your AWS account\. The command displays information as it progresses\.

## Modifying the Code<a name="tutorial_modify_code"></a>

Configure the bucket to use KMS managed encryption:

------
#### [ C\# ]

Update `MyStack.cs`:

```
new Bucket(this, "MyFirstBucket", new BucketProps
{
    Versioned = true,
    Encryption = BucketEncryption.KmsManaged
});
```

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

Update `index.js`:

```
new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyFirstBucket', {
    versioned: true,
    encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.KmsManaged
});
```

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

Update `lib/hello-cdk-stack.ts`

```
new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyFirstBucket', {
    versioned: true,
    encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.KmsManaged
});
```

------
#### [ Java ]

Update `src/main/java/com/acme/MyStack.java`

```
new Bucket(this, "MyFirstBucket", BucketProps.builder()
    .withVersioned(true)
    .withEncryption(BucketEncryption.KmsManaged)
    .build());
```

------

Compile your program:

------
#### [ C\# ]

Since configured `cdk.json` to run dotnet run, which restores dependencies, builds, and runs your application, run the following command:

```
cdk
```

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

Nothing to compile\.

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

```
npm run build
```

------
#### [ Java ]

```
mvn compile
```

------

## Preparing for Deployment<a name="tutorial_prep_deployment"></a>

Before you deploy the updated stack, evaluate the difference between the AWS CDK app and the deployed stack:

```
cdk diff
```

The toolkit queries your AWS account for the current AWS CloudFormation template for the **hello\-cdk** stack, and compares the result with the template synthesized from the app\. The output should look like the following:

```
[~] 🛠 Updating MyFirstBucketB8884501 (type: AWS::S3::Bucket)
└─ [+] .BucketEncryption:
    └─ New value: {"ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration":[{"ServerSideEncryptionByDefault":{"SSEAlgorithm":"aws:kms"}}]}
```

As you can see, the diff indicates that the `ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration` property of the bucket is now set to enable server\-side encryption\.

You can also see that the bucket is not going to be replaced but rather updated \(**Updating MyFirstBucketB8884501**\)\.

Update the stack:

```
cdk deploy
```

The toolkit updates the bucket configuration to enable server\-side KMS encryption for the bucket:

```
⏳  Starting deployment of stack hello-cdk...
 [ 0/2 ] UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS   [AWS::S3::Bucket ] MyFirstBucketB8884501
 [ 1/2 ] UPDATE_COMPLETE      [AWS::S3::Bucket ] MyFirstBucketB8884501
 [ 1/2 ] UPDATE_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS   [AWS::CloudFormation::Stack ] hello-cdk
 [ 2/2 ] UPDATE_COMPLETE      [AWS::CloudFormation::Stack ] hello-cdk
✅  Deployment of stack hello-cdk completed successfully
