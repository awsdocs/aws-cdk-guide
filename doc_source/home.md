# What Is the AWS CDK?<a name="home"></a>

Welcome to the *AWS Cloud Development Kit \(AWS CDK\) Developer Guide*\. This document provides information about the AWS CDK, which is a software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation\.

AWS CloudFormation enables you to:
+ Create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly\.
+ Leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon SNS, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling\.
+ Build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost\-effective applications in the cloud without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure\.
+ Use a template file to create and delete a collection of resources together as a single unit \(a stack\)\.

Use the AWS CDK to define your cloud resources in a familiar programming language\. The AWS CDK supports TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python\. The AWS CDK also provides Developer Preview support for C\#/\.NET, and Java\.

Developers can use one of the supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components known as [Constructs](constructs.md)\. You compose these together into [Stacks](stacks.md) and [Apps](apps.md)\.

## Why Use the AWS CDK?<a name="why_use_cdk"></a>

Let's look at the power of the AWS CDK\. Here is some TypeScript code in an AWS CDK project to create an AWS Fargate service \(this is the code we use in the [Creating an AWS Fargate Service Using the AWS CDK](ecs_example.md)\)\.

```
export class MyEcsConstructStack extends core.Stack {
  constructor(scope: core.App, id: string, props?: core.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, "MyVpc", {
      maxAzs: 3 // Default is all AZs in region
    });

    const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, "MyCluster", {
      vpc: vpc
    });

    // Create a load-balanced Fargate service and make it public
    new ecs_patterns.LoadBalancedFargateService(this, "MyFargateService", {
      cluster: cluster, // Required
      cpu: 512, // Default is 256
      desiredCount: 6, // Default is 1
      image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample"), // Required
      memoryLimitMiB: 2048, // Default is 512
      publicLoadBalancer: true // Default is false
    });
```

This produces an AWS CloudFormation [template of over 500 lines](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-cdk-guide/blob/master/doc_source/my_ecs_construct-stack.yaml); deploying the AWS CDK app produces over 50 resources of the following types\.

Other advantages of the AWS CDK include:
+ Use logic \(if statements, for\-loops, etc\) when defining your infrastructure
+ Use object\-oriented techniques to create a model of your system
+ Define high level abstractions, share them, and publish them to your team, company, or community
+ Organize your project into logical modules
+ Share and reuse your infrastructure as a library
+ Testing your infrastructure code using industry\-standard protocols
+ Use your existing code review workflow
+ Code completion within your IDE

## Developing with the AWS CDK<a name="developing"></a>

Unless otherwise indicated, the code examples in this guide are in TypeScript\. To aid you in porting a TypeScript example to a supported programming language, see [AWS CDK in Other Languages ](multiple_languages.md)\. The AWS CDK also includes examples in the supported programming languages\. See [AWS CDK Examples](about_examples.md) for a list of the examples\.

The [AWS CDK Tools](tools.md) is a command line tool for interacting with CDK apps\. It enables developers to synthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts, and diff against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change\.

The [AWS Construct Library](constructs.md) includes a module for each AWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of how to create resources for an Amazon or AWS service\. The aim of the AWS Construct Library is to reduce the complexity and glue logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals on AWS\.

**Note**  
There is no charge for using the AWS CDK, however you might incur AWS charges for creating or using AWS [chargeable resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#chargeable-resources), such as running Amazon EC2 instances or using Amazon S3 storage\. Use the [AWS Simple Monthly Calculator](http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to estimate charges for the use of various AWS resources\.

## Contributing to the AWS CDK<a name="contributing"></a>

Because the AWS CDK is open source, the team encourages you contribute to make it an even better tool\. For details, see [Contributing](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\.

## About Amazon Web Services<a name="about_aws"></a>

Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) is a collection of digital infrastructure services that developers can use when developing their applications\. The services include computing, storage, database, and application synchronization \(messaging and queuing\)\.

AWS uses a pay\-as\-you\-go service model\. You are charged only for the services that you — or your applications — use\. Also, to make AWS useful as a platform for prototyping and experimentation, AWS offers a free usage tier, in which services are free below a certain level of usage\. For more information about AWS costs and the free usage tier, see [Test\-Driving AWS in the Free Usage Tier](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-free-tier.html)\.

To obtain an AWS account, go to [aws\.amazon\.com](https://aws.amazon.com), and then choose **Create an AWS Account**\.
