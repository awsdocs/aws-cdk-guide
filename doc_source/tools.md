# AWS CDK Tools<a name="tools"></a>

This section contains information about AWS CDK tools\.

## AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code<a name="vscode"></a>

The [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudiocode/) is an open source plug\-in for Visual Studio Code that makes it easier to create, debug, and deploy applications on AWS\. The toolkit provides an integrated experience for developing AWS CDK applications, including the AWS CDK Explorer feature to list your AWS CDK projects and browse the various components of the CDK application\. [Install the AWS Toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/setup-toolkit.html) and learn more about [using the AWS CDK Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/cdk-explorer.html)\.

## AWS CDK Toolkit \(`cdk`\)<a name="cli"></a>

The AWS CDK Toolkit, the CLI cdk, is the main tool you use to interact with your AWS CDK app\. It executes the AWS CDK app you wrote and compiled, interrogates the application model you defined, and produces and deploys the AWS CloudFormation templates generated by the AWS CDK\.

There are two ways to tell cdk what command to use to run your AWS CDK app\. The first way is to include an explicit \-\-app option whenever you use a cdk command\.

```
cdk --app "npx ts-node bin/hello-cdk.ts" ls
```

The second way is to add the following entry to the `cdk.json` file \(if you use the cdk init command, the command does this for you\)\.

```
{
  "app": "npx ts-node bin/hello-cdk.ts"
}
```

You can also use npx cdk instead of just cdk\. npx cdk looks for a locally\-installed copy of the AWS CDK CLI in the current project before falling back to a global installation\.

Here are the actions you can take on your AWS CDK app \(this is the output of the cdk \-\-help command\)\.

```

as defaults. Settings in cdk.json take precedence.

### Bootstrapping your AWS Environment<a name="tools_bootstrap"></a>

Before you can use the AWS CDK you must bootstrap your AWS environment to create the infrastructure that the AWS CDK CLI needs to deploy your AWS CDK app\. Currently the bootstrap command creates only an Amazon S3 bucket\.

You incur any charges for what the AWS CDK stores in the bucket\. Because the AWS CDK does not remove any objects from the bucket, the bucket can accumulate objects as you use the AWS CDK\. You can get rid of the bucket by deleting the **CDKToolkit** stack from your AWS account\. 

### Security\-Related Changes<a name="tools_security"></a>

To protect you against unintended changes that affect your security posture, the AWS CDK toolkit prompts you to approve security\-related changes before deploying them\.

You change the level of changes that requires approval by specifying:

```
cdk deploy --require-approval LEVEL
```

Where *LEVEL* can be one of the following:

never  
Approval is never required\.

any\-change  
Requires approval on any IAM or security\-group related change\.

broadening  
\(default\) Requires approval when IAM statements or traffic rules are added\. Removals don't require approval\.

The setting can also be configured in the `cdk.json` file\.

```
{
  "app": "...",
  "requireApproval": "never"
}
```

### Version Reporting<a name="version_reporting"></a>

To gain insight into how the AWS CDK is used, the versions of libraries used by AWS CDK applications are collected and reported by using a resource identified as `AWS::CDK::Metadata`\. This resource is added to AWS CloudFormation templates, and can easily be reviewed\. This information can also be used to identify stacks using a package with known serious security or reliability issues, and to contact their users with important information\.

The AWS CDK reports the name and version of `npm` modules that are loaded into the application at synthesis time, unless their `package.json` file contains the `"private": true` attribute\.

The `AWS::CDK::Metadata` resource looks like the following\.

```
CDKMetadata:
  Type: "AWS::CDK::Metadata"
  Properties:
    Modules: "@aws-cdk/core=0.7.2-beta,@aws-cdk/s3=0.7.2-beta,lodash=4.17.10"
```

### Opting Out from Version Reporting<a name="version_reporting_opt_out"></a>

To opt out of version reporting, use one of the following methods:
+ Use the cdk command with the \-\-no\-version\-reporting argument\.

  ```
  cdk --no-version-reporting synth
  ```
+ Set versionReporting to **false** in `./cdk.json` or `~/cdk.json`\.

  ```
  {
    "app": "...",
    "versionReporting": false
  }
  ```

## SAM CLI<a name="sam"></a>

This topic describes how to use the SAM CLI with the AWS CDK to test a Lambda function locally\. For further information, see [Invoking Functions Locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-invoke.html)\. To install the SAM CLI, see [Installing the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)\.

1. The first step is to create a AWS CDK application and add the Lambda package\.

   ```
   mkdir cdk-sam-example
   cd cdk-sam-example
   cdk init app --language typescript
   npm install @aws-cdk/aws-lambda
   ```

1. Add a Lambda reference to `lib/cdk-sam-example-stack.ts`:

   ```
   import lambda = require('@aws-cdk/aws-lambda');
   ```

1. Replace the comment in `lib/cdk-sam-example-stack.ts` with the following Lambda function:

   ```
   new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
     runtime: lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_7,
     handler: 'app.lambda_handler',
     code:    lambda.Code.asset('./my_function'),
   });
   ```

1. Create the directory `my_function`

   ```
   mkdir my_function
   ```

1. Create the file `app.py` in `my_function` with the following content:

   ```
   def lambda_handler(event, context):
     return "This is a Lambda Function defined through CDK"
   ```

1. Compile your AWS CDK app and create a AWS CloudFormation template

   ```
   npm run build
   cdk synth --no-staging > template.yaml
   ```

1. Find the logical ID for your Lambda function in `template.yaml`\. It will look like `MyFunction`*12345678*, where *12345678* represents an 8\-character unique ID that the AWS CDK generates for all resources\. The line right after it should look like:

   ```
   Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
   ```

1. Run the function by executing:

   ```
   sam local invoke MyFunction12345678 --no-event
   ```

   The output should look something like the following\.

   ```
