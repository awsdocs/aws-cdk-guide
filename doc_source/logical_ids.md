# Logical IDs<a name="logical_ids"></a>

When you synthesize a stack into an AWS CloudFormation template, the AWS CDK assigns a [logical ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html), which must be unique within the template, to each resource in the stack\.

**Important**  
When you update the template, AWS CloudFormation uses these logical IDs to plan the update and apply changes\. Therefore, logical IDs must remain "stable" across updates\. If you make a modification in your code that results in a change to a logical ID of a resource, AWS CloudFormation deletes the resource and creates a new resource when it updates the stack\.

Each resource in your CDK app has a unique path that represents its location within the scope hierarchy\. Since logical IDs can only use alphanumeric characters and cannot exceed 255 characters, the CDK is unable to simply use a delimited path as the logical ID\. Instead, logical IDs are allocated by concatenating a human\-friendly rendition from the path \(concatenation, de\-duplicate, trim\) with an eight\-character MD5 hash of the delimited path\. This final component is necessary since AWS CloudFormation logical IDs cannot include the delimiting slash character \(/\), so simply concatenating the component values does not work\. For example, concatenating the components of the path */a/b/c* produces **abc**, which is the same as concatenating the components of the path */ab/c*\.

```

Low\-level CloudFormation resources \(from `@aws-cdk/resources`\) that are direct children of the [Stack](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_cdk.html#@aws-cdk/cdk.Stack) class use their name as their logical ID without modification\. This makes it easier to port existing templates into a CDK app\.

This scheme ensures that:

Logical IDs have a human\-friendly portion  
This is useful when interacting directly with the synthesized AWS CloudFormation template during development and deployment\.

Logical IDs are unique within the stack  
This is ensured by the MD5 component, which is based on the absolute path to the resource, which is unique within a stack\.

Logical IDs remain unchanged across updates  
This is true as long as their location within the scope hierarchy doesn't change\.

The AWS CDK applies some heuristics to improve the human\-friendliness of the prefix:
+ If a path component is **Default**, it is hidden completely from the logical ID computation\. You will generally want to use this if you create a new construct that wraps an existing one\. By naming the inner construct **Default**, you ensure that the logical identifiers of resources in already\-deployed copy of that construct do not change\.
+ If a path component is **Resource**, it is omitted from the human readable portion of the logical ID\. This postfix does not normally contribute any additional useful information to the ID\.
+ If two subsequent names in the path are the same, only one is retained\.
+ If the prefix exceeds 240 characters, it is trimmed to 240 characters\. This ensures that the total length of the logical ID does not exceed the 255 character AWS CloudFormation limit for logical IDs\.

## Renaming Logical IDs<a name="logical_ids_renaming"></a>

The `aws-cdk.Stack.renameLogical` method can be used to explicitly assign logical IDs to certain resources\.

```
class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: App, id: string, props: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id);

    // note that renameLogical must be called /before/ defining the construct.
    // a good practice would be to always put these at the top of your stack initializer.
    this.renameLogical('MyTableCD117FA1', 'MyTable');
    this.renameLogical('MyQueueAB4432A3', 'MyAwesomeQueue');

    new Table(this, 'MyTable');
    new Queue(this, 'MyQueue');
  }
}
```

In some cases changing a resource results in a structural change, which results in a different path, thus changing the logical ID of the resource\.

When a resource's logical ID changes, AWS CloudFormation eventually deletes the old resource and create a new resource, as it cannot determine that the two resources are the same\. Depending on the nature of the resource, this can be disastrous in production, such as when deleting a DynamoDB table\.

You could use [AWS CloudFormation Stack Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html) to protect critical resources in your stack from accidental deletion\. Although this AWS CloudFormation feature is not supported in the AWS CDK and AWS CDK Toolkit, the AWS CDK does provide a few other mechanisms to help deal with logical ID changes\.

If you have CDK stacks deployed with persistent resources such as S3 buckets or DynamoDB tables, you might want to explicitly "rename" the new logical IDs to match your existing resources\.

First, make sure you compare the newly synthesized template with any deployed stacks\. `cdk diff` will tell you which resources are about to be destroyed:

```
[-] ‚ò¢Ô∏è Destroying MyTable (type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table)
[+] üÜï Creating MyTableCD117FA1 (type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table)
```

Now, you can add a `aws-cdk.Stack.renameLogical` call before the table is defined to rename **MyTableCD117FA1** to **MyTable**\.
