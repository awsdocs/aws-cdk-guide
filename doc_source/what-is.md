# What Is the AWS Cloud Development Kit?<a name="what-is"></a>

Welcome to the AWS Cloud Development Kit \(AWS CDK\) User's Guide\.

The AWS CDK is an infrastructure modeling framework that allows you to define your cloud resources using an imperative programming interface\. *The AWS CDK is currently in developer preview\. We look forward to community feedback and collaboration*\.

## Why Should you use the AWS CDK?<a name="why_use_cdk"></a>

Perhaps the best reason is shown graphically\. Here is the TypeScript code in an AWS CDK project to create a Fargate service \(this is the code we use in the [Creating an Amazon ECS Fargate Service Using the AWS CDK](ecs_example.md)\):

```
export class MyEcsConstructStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
     
    const vpc = new ec2.VpcNetwork(this, 'MyVpc', {
      maxAZs: 3 // Default is all AZs in region
    });
     
    const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, 'MyCluster', {
      vpc: vpc
    });
     
    // Create a load-balanced Fargate service and make it public
    new ecs.LoadBalancedFargateService(this, 'MyFargateService', {
      cluster: cluster,  // Required
      cpu: '512', // Default is 256
      desiredCount: 6,  // Default is 1
      image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromDockerHub('amazon/amazon-ecs-sample'), // Required
      memoryMiB: '2048',  // Default is 512
      publicLoadBalancer: true  // Default is false
    });
  }
}
```

This produces a AWS CloudFormation template of over 600 lines\. We'll show the first and last 25:

## The Developer Experience<a name="developer_experience"></a>

To get started see [Installing and Configuring the AWS CDK](install_config.md)\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/CDK/latest/userguide/images/screencast.gif)

Developers can use one of the supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components called [Constructs](constructs.md), which are composed together into [Stacks](stacks.md) and [Apps](apps.md)\.

**Note**  
Unless otherwise indicated, the code examples in this guide are in TypeScript\.  
To aid you in porting a TypeScript example to a supported programming language, take a look at the example code for your language in the [Reference](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/reference.html)\.

The [Command\-line Toolkit \(cdk\)](tools.md) is a command\-line tool for interacting with CDK apps\. It allows developers to synthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation Templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts and diff against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change\.

The [AWS Construct Library](aws_construct_lib.md) includes a module for each AWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of how to use AWS\. The AWS Construct Library aims to reduce the complexity and glue\-logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals on AWS\.

**Note**  
There is no charge for using the AWS CDK, however you may incur AWS charges for creating or using AWS [chargeable resources](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#chargeable-resources), such as running Amazon EC2 instances or using Amazon S3 storage\. Use the [AWS Simple Monthly Calculator](http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to estimate charges for the use of various AWS resources\.

## About Amazon Web Services<a name="about_aws"></a>

Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) is a collection of digital infrastructure services that developers can leverage when developing their applications\. The services include computing, storage, database, and application synchronization \(messaging and queuing\)\.

AWS uses a pay\-as\-you\-go service model\. You are charged only for the services that you — or your applications — use\. Also, to make AWS useful as a platform for prototyping and experimentation, AWS offers a free usage tier, in which services are free below a certain level of usage\. For more information about AWS costs and the free usage tier, see [Test\-Driving AWS in the Free Usage Tier](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-free-tier.html)\.
