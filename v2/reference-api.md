# API reference<a name="reference-api"></a>

The [API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2) contains information about the AWS Construct Library and other APIs provided by the AWS Cloud Development Kit \(AWS CDK\)\. Most of the AWS Construct Library is contained in a single package called by its TypeScript name: `aws-cdk-lib`\. The actual package name varies by language\. Separate versions of the API reference are provided for each supported programming language\.

The CDK API reference is organized into sub\-modules\. There are one or more sub\-modules for each AWS service\.

Each sub\-module has an overview that includes information about how to use its APIs\. For example, the [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3-readme.html) overview demonstrates how to set default encryption on an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\.
