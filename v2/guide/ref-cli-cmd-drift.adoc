:keywords: {aws} CDK, {aws} CDK CLI, CDK Toolkit CLI, cdk drift

[abstract]
--
Detect and report drift in deployed {aws} CloudFormation stacks that are defined in your CDK app.
--

// Content start

Detect configuration drift for resources that you define, manage, and deploy using the {aws} Cloud Development Kit ({aws} CDK). Drift occurs when a stack's actual configuration differs from its expected configuration, which happens when resources are modified outside of {aws} CloudFormation.

This command identifies resources that have been modified (for example, through the {aws} Console or {aws} CLI) by comparing their current state against their expected configuration. These modifications can cause unexpected behavior in your infrastructure.

During drift detection, the CDK CLI will output progress indicators and results, showing:

- Resources that have drifted from their expected configuration.
- The total number of resources with drift.
- A summary indicating whether drift was detected in the stack.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `cdk drift` and `cdk diff` commands work differently:

* `cdk drift` calls CloudFormation's drift detection operation to compare the actual state of resources in {aws} ("reality") against their expected configuration in CloudFormation.  Not all {aws} resources support drift detection. For a list of supported resources, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html[Resource type support] in the _{aws} CloudFormation User Guide_.

* `cdk diff` compares the CloudFormation template synthesized from your local CDK code against the template of the deployed CloudFormation stack.

Use `cdk drift` when you need to verify if resources have been modified outside of CloudFormation (for example, through the {aws} Console or {aws} CLI). Use `cdk diff` when you want to preview how your local code changes would affect your infrastructure before deployment.

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-usage]
== Usage

[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ cdk drift <arguments> <options>
----

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-args]
== Arguments

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-args-stack-name]
*Stack name*::
The name of the stack that you want to check for drift. The stack must be previously deployed to CloudFormation to perform drift detection.
+
_Type_: String
+
_Required_: No
+
If no stack is specified, drift detection will be performed on all stacks defined in your CDK app.

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-options]
== Options

For a list of global options that work with all CDK CLI commands, see xref:ref-cli-cmd-options[Global options].

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-options-fail]
`--fail <BOOLEAN>`::
Return with exit code 1 if drift is detected.
+
_Default value_: `false`

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-options-help]
`--help, -h <BOOLEAN>`::
Show command reference information for the `cdk drift` command.

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-examples]
== Examples

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-examples-stack]
=== Check drift for a specific stack

[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ cdk drift MyStackName
----

The command will output results similar to:

[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
Stack MyStackName
Modified Resources
[~] AWS::Lambda::Function MyFunction MyLambdaFunc1234ABCD
 └─ [~] /Description
     ├─ [-] My original hello world Lambda function
     └─ [+] My drifted hello world Lambda function

1 resource has drifted from their expected configuration

✨  Number of resources with drift: 1
----

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-examples-deleted]
=== Check drift when resources have been deleted

The following example shows what the output looks like when resources have been both modified and deleted:

[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
Stack MyStackName
Modified Resources
[~] AWS::Lambda::Function MyFunction MyLambdaFunc1234ABCD
 └─ [~] /Description
     ├─ [-] My original hello world Lambda function
     └─ [+] My drifted hello world Lambda function
Deleted Resources
[-] AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm MyAlarm MyCWAlarmABCD1234

2 resources have drifted from their expected configuration

✨  Number of resources with drift: 2
----

[#ref-cli-cmd-drift-examples-fail]
=== Check drift with exit code

To have the command return a non-zero exit code if drift is detected:

[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ cdk drift MyStackName --fail
----

This is useful in CI/CD pipelines to automatically detect and respond to infrastructure drift.
