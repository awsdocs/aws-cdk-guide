The {aws} Cloud Development Kit ({aws} CDK) is an open-source software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through {aws} CloudFormation.
--

The {aws} Cloud Development Kit ({aws} CDK) is an open-source software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through {aws} CloudFormation.

The {aws} CDK consists of two primary parts:



* *xref:constructs[{aws} CDK Construct Library]* – A collection of pre-written modular and reusable pieces of code, called constructs, that you can use, modify, and integrate to develop your infrastructure quickly. The goal of the {aws} CDK Construct Library is to reduce the complexity required to define and integrate {aws} services together when building applications on {aws}.
* *xref:cli[{aws} CDK Command Line Interface ({aws} CDK CLI)]* – A command line tool for interacting with CDK apps. Use the CDK CLI to create, manage, and deploy your {aws} CDK projects. The CDK  CLI is also referred to as the CDK Toolkit.

The {aws} CDK supports  [.noloc]``TypeScript``,  JavaScript,  Python,  Java,  [.noloc]``C#/.Net``, and  [.noloc]``Go``. You can use any of these supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components known as  xref:constructs[constructs]. You compose these together into xref:stacks[stacks] and xref:apps[apps]. Then, you deploy your CDK applications to {aws} CloudFormation to provision or update your resources.

[[home-benefits,home-benefits.title]]
== Benefits of the {aws} CDK

Use the {aws} CDK to develop reliable, scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud with the considerable expressive power of a programming language. This approach yields many benefits, including:



[[home-benefits-iac]]
Develop and manage your infrastructure as code (IaC)::
Practice _infrastructure as code_ to create, deploy, and maintain infrastructure in a programmatic, descriptive, and declarative way. With IaC, you treat infrastructure the same way developers treat code. This results in a scalable and structured approach to managing infrastructure. To learn more about IaC, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/infrastructure-as-code.html[Infrastructure as code] in the __Introduction to DevOps on {aws} Whitepaper__.
+

With the {aws} CDK, you can put your infrastructure, application code, and configuration all in one place, ensuring that you have a complete, cloud-deployable system at every milestone. Employ software engineering best practices such as code reviews, unit tests, and source control to make your infrastructure more robust.


[[home-benefits-languages]]
Define your cloud infrastructure using general-purpose programming languages::
With the {aws} CDK, you can use any of the following programming languages to define your cloud infrastructure: [.noloc]``TypeScript``,  JavaScript,  Python,  Java,  [.noloc]``C#/.Net``, and  [.noloc]``Go``. Choose your preferred language and use programming elements like parameters, conditionals, loops, composition, and inheritance to define the desired outcome of your infrastructure.
+

Use the same programming language to define your infrastructure and your application logic.
+

Receive the benefits of developing infrastructure in your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment), such as syntax highlighting and intelligent code completion.
+
image::images/CodeCompletion.png[Code snippet showing {aws} CDK setup for ECS cluster with VPC and Fargate service configuration.,scaledwidth=100%]


[[home-benefits-cfn]]
Deploy infrastructure through {aws} CloudFormation::
{aws} CDK integrates with {aws} CloudFormation to deploy and provision your infrastructure on {aws}. {aws} CloudFormation is a managed {aws} service that offers extensive support of resource and property configurations for provisioning services on {aws}. With {aws} CloudFormation, you can perform infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly, with rollback on error. If you are already familiar with {aws} CloudFormation, you don`'t have to learn a new IaC management service when getting started with the {aws} CDK.


[[home-benefits-constructs]]
Get started developing your application quickly with constructs::
Develop faster by using and sharing reusable components called constructs. Use low-level constructs to define individual {aws} CloudFormation resources and their properties. Use high-level constructs to quickly define larger components of your application, with sensible, secure defaults for your {aws} resources, defining more infrastructure with less code.
+

Create your own constructs that are customized for your unique use cases and share them across your organization or even with the public.


[[home-example,home-example.title]]
== Example of the {aws} CDK

The following is an example of using the {aws} CDK Constructs Library to create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service with {aws} Fargate launch type. For more details of this example, see  xref:ecs-example[Example: Create an {aws} Fargate service using the {aws} CDK].
