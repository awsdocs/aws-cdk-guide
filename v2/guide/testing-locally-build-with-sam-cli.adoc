// Content start

The {aws} SAMÂ CLI provides support for building Lambda functions and layers defined in your {aws} CDK application with `link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build.html[sam build]`.

For Lambda functions that use zip artifacts, run `cdk synth` before you run `sam local` commands. `sam build` isn't required.

If your {aws} CDK application uses functions with the image type, run `cdk synth` and then run `sam build` before you run `sam local` commands. When you run `sam build`, {aws} SAM doesn't build Lambda functions or layers that use runtime-specific constructs, for example, `link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda_nodejs.NodejsFunction.html[NodejsFunction]`. `sam build` doesn't support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.BundlingOptions.html[bundled assets].

[#testing-locally-build-with-sam-cli-examples]
== Example

Running the following command from the {aws} CDK project root directory builds the application.
