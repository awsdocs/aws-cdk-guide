// Content start

Get started with using the {aws} CDK Toolkit Library to programmatically perform CDK actions, such as synthesis and deployment, in your code.

[#toolkit-library-gs-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

. Supported version of Node.js installed.
. {aws} credentials configured.
. Basic familiarity with the {aws} CDK.

For more information, see xref:prerequisites[{aws} CDK prerequisites].

[#toolkit-library-gs-install]
== Step 1: Installing the CDK Toolkit Library

Install the CDK Toolkit Library package in your project's development environment by running the following:

[source,none,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
npm install --save @aws-cdk/toolkit-lib
----

[#toolkit-library-gs-initialize]
== Step 2: Initializing the CDK Toolkit Library

Create a CDK Toolkit instance to perform programmatic actions on your CDK app.

[source,typescript,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
import { Toolkit } from '@aws-cdk/toolkit-lib';

const toolkit = new Toolkit({
    // Optional configuration options go here
});
----

You can customize the CDK Toolkit instance during creation. For instructions, see xref:toolkit-library-configure[Configure your CDK Toolkit instance].

[#toolkit-library-gs-ca]
== Step 3: Creating a cloud assembly source for your CDK app

A cloud assembly source provides instructions for generating CloudFormation templates from your CDK app. You can create one in multiple ways. The following are a few examples:

--
. *An inline assembly builder function*:
+
[source,typescript,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';

const cloudAssemblySource = await toolkit.fromAssemblyBuilder(async () => {
  const app = new cdk.App();
  new MyStack(app, 'MyStack');
  return app.synth();
});
----
+

. *An existing CDK app file*:
+
[source,typescript,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
const cloudAssemblySource = await toolkit.fromCdkApp("ts-node app.ts");
----
--

For more information, see xref:toolkit-library-configure-ca[Configure cloud assembly sources].

[#toolkit-library-gs-define]
== Step 4: Defining programmatic actions for your CDK app

Now that youâ€™ve created a CDK Toolkit instance and cloud assembly source, you can start to define programmatic actions. The following is a basic example that creates a deployment of the `MyStack` stack:

[source,typescript,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
import { StackSelectionStrategy } from '@aws-cdk/toolkit-lib';

await toolkit.deploy(cloudAssemblySource, {
  stacks: {
    strategy: StackSelectionStrategy.PATTERN_MUST_MATCH, // Deploy only stacks that exactly match the provided patterns
    patterns: ["MyStack"],
  },
});
----

[#toolkit-library-gs-customize]
== Step 5: Customizing the CDK Toolkit further

You can configure and customize the CDK Toolkit further for your needs:

* *Messages and interactions* - Configure how the CDK Toolkit communicates with users and applications. See xref:toolkit-library-configure-messages[Configure messages & interactions].
* *Error handling* - Implement structured error handling for CDK operations. See xref:toolkit-library-configure-errors[Configure error handling].
