// Content start

Acknowledge a notice by issue number and hide it from displaying again.

This is useful to hide notices that have been addressed or do not apply to you.

Acknowledgements are saved at a CDK project level. If you acknowledge a notice in one CDK project, it will still display in other projects until acknowledged there.
