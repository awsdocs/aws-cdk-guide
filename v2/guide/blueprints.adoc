CDK Blueprints allow organizations to standardize L2 construct configurations through property injection, making it easier for developers to follow best practices while maintaining flexibility.
--

// Content start

Use {aws} CDK Blueprints to standardize and distribute L2 construct configurations across your organization. With Blueprints, you can ensure that {aws} resources are configured consistently according to your organizational standards and best practices. For example, you can automatically enable encryption for all Amazon S3 buckets, apply specific logging configurations to all {aws} Lambda functions, or enforce standard security rules for all security groups.

Blueprints are powered by _property injection_, a mechanism introduced in {aws} CDK link:https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v2.196.0[v2.196.0] that allows you to modify construct properties at instantiation time. A Blueprint is a collection of property injectors, where each property injector specifies optimal configuration for a specific L2 construct. The Blueprint represents the overall best practices for your organization.

Blueprints are not a compliance enforcement mechanism. Developers can still override the defaults if needed. For strict compliance enforcement, consider using {aws} CloudFormation Guard, Service Control Policies, or CDK Aspects in addition to Blueprints.

For detailed implementation information, see the link:https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/blob/main/text/0693-property-injection.md[Property Injection RFC].

[#blueprints-key-pieces]
== Key components of Blueprints

Blueprints are collections of property injectors that apply default properties to constructs when they're instantiated. A property injector is a component that implements the `IPropertyInjector` interface, which intercepts construct creation and modifies or adds properties before the construct is created.

* *IPropertyInjector* - An `link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.IPropertyInjector.html[IPropertyInjector]` defines a way to inject additional properties that are not specified in the props. It is specific to one L2 construct and operates on that construct's properties.

* *PropertyInjectors* - `link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.PropertyInjectors.html[PropertyInjectors]` are a collection of injectors attached to the construct tree. Injectors can be attached to any construct, but in practice we expect most of them will be attached to `App`, `Stage` or `Stack`.

[#blueprints-use-cases]
== Common use cases for Blueprints

You can use CDK Blueprints to standardize many aspects of your AWS resources. Here are some common use cases:

*Security standards*::
+
--
* Ensure all Amazon S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled.
* Configure all security groups to block public access by default.
* Apply least-privilege AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to {aws} Lambda functions.
* Enforce SSL for all network communications.
--

*Operational excellence*::
+
--
* Configure standardized logging for all {aws} Lambda functions.
* Apply consistent tagging strategies across resources.
* Set up default monitoring and alerting thresholds.
* Implement standard retention policies for logs and backups.
--

*Cost optimization*::
+
--
* Configure appropriate instance sizes based on environment.
* Apply auto-scaling policies with organizational defaults.
* Set lifecycle rules for Amazon S3 buckets to transition objects to cheaper storage classes.
* Configure default provisioned throughput for databases.
--

*Compliance requirements*::
+
--
* Implement required encryption settings for regulated data.
* Apply necessary backup policies for data retention requirements.
* Configure default Amazon VPC settings that meet security requirements.
* Ensure resources have required tags for cost allocation.
--

*Developer productivity*::
+
--
* Provide sensible defaults that reduce the need for boilerplate code.
* Create organization-specific Stack classes with built-in injectors.
* Share best practices across teams through reusable injectors.
* Simplify onboarding by encoding organizational knowledge in code.

[#blueprints-getting-started]
== Getting started with Blueprints

Here's a simple example of how to create and use a property injector:

First, create a property injector for Amazon S3 buckets:

[source,typescript,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
import { IPropertyInjector, InjectionContext } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Bucket, BucketProps, BlockPublicAccess } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';

export class SecureBucketDefaults implements IPropertyInjector {
  public readonly constructUniqueId: string;

  constructor() {
    this.constructUniqueId = Bucket.PROPERTY_INJECTION_ID;
  }

  public inject(originalProps: BucketProps, _context: InjectionContext): BucketProps {
    return {
      // Set security defaults
      blockPublicAccess: BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,
      enforceSSL: true,
      
      // Include original props to allow overrides
      ...originalProps,
    };
  }
}
----

Then, use the injector in your CDK application:

[source,typescript,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
import { App, Stack } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Bucket } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
import { SecureBucketDefaults } from './secure-bucket-defaults';

// Attach injectors when creating the App
const app = new App({
  propertyInjectors: [new SecureBucketDefaults()]
});

const stack = new Stack(app, 'MyStack');

// This bucket automatically gets the default properties
const myBucket = new Bucket(stack, 'MyBucket');
----

Alternatively, you can use the `PropertyInjectors.of()` method:

[source,typescript,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
import { App, Stack, PropertyInjectors } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { SecureBucketDefaults } from './secure-bucket-defaults';

const app = new App();
PropertyInjectors.of(app).add(new SecureBucketDefaults());

const stack = new Stack(app, 'MyStack');
const myBucket = new Bucket(stack, 'MyBucket');
----

[#blueprints-best-practices]
== Best practices

* Place default properties before `...originalProps` to allow overrides.
* Place forced properties after `...originalProps` to prevent overrides.
* Use a skip flag when creating resources to prevent infinite recursion. For an example, see link:https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/blob/main/text/0693-property-injection.md#what-happens-when-you-need-to-create-a-accesslogbucket-for-a-bucket[What happens when you need to create a accessLogBucket for a Bucket?] in the _Property Injection RFC_.
* Add logging for debugging.
* Use CDK context to enable/disable injectors for testing.
