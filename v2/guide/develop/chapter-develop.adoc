Manage your infrastructure on {aws} by developing applications using the {aws} Cloud Development Kit ({aws} CDK).

[#develop-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before you can start developing applications, complete all set up steps in xref:getting-started[Getting started with the {aws} CDK].

[#develop-overview]
== Developing {aws} CDK applications overview

At a high-level, developing CDK applications involves the following steps:

. *Create a CDK project* – A CDK xref:projects[project] consists of the files and folders that store and organize your CDK code.
. *Create a CDK app* – Within a CDK project, you use the `App` construct to define a CDK xref:apps[application].
. *Create a CDK stack* – Within the scope of your CDK app, you define one or more CDK xref:stacks[stacks].
. *Define your infrastructure* – Within the scope of a CDK stack, you use xref:constructs[constructs] from the {aws} Construct Library to define the {aws} resources and properties that will become your infrastructure. Using a general-purpose programming xref:languages[language] of your choice, you can use logic, such as conditional statements and loops, to define your infrastructure based on certain conditions.

[#develop-gs]
== Get started with developing CDK applications

To get started, you can use the {aws} CDK Command Line Interface ({aws} CDK  CLI) `cdk init` command. Provide the `--language` option to specify the programming language to use. This command creates a starting CDK project and imports the main {aws} Construct Library and core modules.

[#develop-library]
== Import and use the {aws} CDK Library

After you create a CDK project, import and use constructs from the {aws} CDK Library to begin defining your infrastructure. For instructions, see xref:work-with[Work with the {aws} CDK library].

[#develop-next]
== Next steps

When ready to deploy your application, use the CDK  CLI `cdk deploy` command. For instructions, see xref:deploy[Deploy {aws} CDK applications].
