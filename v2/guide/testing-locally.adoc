// Content start

You can use the {aws} SAM CLI to locally test and build serverless applications defined using the {aws} Cloud Development Kit ({aws} CDK). Because the {aws} SAM CLI works within the {aws} CDK project structure, you can still use the xref:cli[{aws} CDK CLI reference] for creating, modifying, and deploying your {aws} CDK applications.

For details on using {aws} SAM, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started.html[Getting started with {aws} SAM] in the _{aws} Serverless Application Model Developer Guide_.
