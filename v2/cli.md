# AWS CDK Toolkit \(`cdk` command\)<a name="cli"></a>

The AWS CDK Toolkit, the CLI command `cdk`, is the primary tool for interacting with your AWS CDK app\. It executes your app, interrogates the application model you defined, and produces and deploys the AWS CloudFormation templates generated by the AWS CDK\. It also provides other features useful for creating and working with AWS CDK projects\. This topic contains information about common use cases of the CDK Toolkit\.

The AWS CDK Toolkit is installed with the Node Package Manager\. In most cases, we recommend installing it globally\.

```
npm install -g aws-cdk             # install latest version
npm install -g aws-cdk@X.YY.Z      # install specific version
```

**Tip**  
If you regularly work with multiple versions of the AWS CDK, consider installing a matching version of the AWS CDK Toolkit in individual CDK projects\. To do this, omit `-g` from the `npm install` command\. Then use `npx aws-cdk` to invoke it\. This runs the local version if one exists, falling back to a global version if not\.

## Toolkit commands<a name="cli-commands"></a>

All CDK Toolkit commands start with `cdk`, which is followed by a subcommand \(`list`, `synthesize`, `deploy`, etc\.\)\. Some subcommands have a shorter version \(`ls`, `synth`, etc\.\) that is equivalent\. Options and arguments follow the subcommand in any order\.

For a description of all subcommands, options, and arguments, see [AWS CDK CLI command reference](ref-cli-cmd.md)\.

## Specifying options and their values<a name="cli-options"></a>

Command line options begin with two hyphens \(`--`\)\. Some frequently used options have single\-letter synonyms that begin with a single hyphen \(for example, `--app` has a synonym `-a`\)\. The order of options in an AWS CDK Toolkit command is not important\.

All options accept a value, which must follow the option name\. The value may be separated from the name by white space or by an equals sign `=`\. The following two options are equivalent\.

```
--toolkit-stack-name MyBootstrapStack
--toolkit-stack-name=MyBootstrapStack
```

Some options are flags \(Booleans\)\. You may specify `true` or `false` as their value\. If you do not provide a value, the value is taken to be `true`\. You may also prefix the option name with `no-` to imply `false`\.

```
# sets staging flag to true
--staging
--staging=true
--staging true

# sets staging flag to false
--no-staging
--staging=false
--staging false
```

A few options, namely `--context`, `--parameters`, `--plugin`, `--tags`, and `--trust`, may be specified more than once to specify multiple values\. These are noted as having `[array]` type in the CDK Toolkit help\. For example:

```
cdk bootstrap --tags costCenter=0123 --tags responsibleParty=jdoe
```

## Built\-in help<a name="cli-help"></a>

The AWS CDK Toolkit has integrated help\. You can see general help about the utility and a list of the provided subcommands by issuing:

```
cdk --help
```

To see help for a particular subcommand, for example `deploy`, specify it before the `--help` flag\.

```
cdk deploy --help
```

Issue `cdk version` to display the version of the AWS CDK Toolkit\. Provide this information when requesting support\.

## Version reporting<a name="version_reporting"></a>

To gain insight into how the AWS CDK is used, the constructs used by AWS CDK applications are collected and reported by using a resource identified as `AWS::CDK::Metadata`\. This resource is added to AWS CloudFormation templates, and can easily be reviewed\. This information can also be used by AWS to identify stacks using a construct with known security or reliability issues\. It can also be used to contact their users with important information\.

**Note**  
Before version 1\.93\.0, the AWS CDK reported the names and versions of the modules loaded during synthesis, instead of the constructs used in the stack\.

By default, the AWS CDK reports the use of constructs in the following NPM modules that are used in the stack:
+ AWS CDK core module
+ AWS Construct Library modules
+ AWS Solutions Constructs module
+ AWS Render Farm Deployment Kit module

The `AWS::CDK::Metadata` resource looks something like the following\.

```
CDKMetadata:
  Type: "AWS::CDK::Metadata"
  Properties:
    Analytics: "v2:deflate64:H4sIAND9SGAAAzXKSw5AMBAA0L1b2PdzBYnEAdio3RglglY60zQi7u6TWL/XKmNUlxeQSOKwaPTBqrNhwEWU3hGHiCzK0dWWfAxoL/Fd8mvk+QkS/0X6BdjnCdgmOOQKWz+AqqLDt2Y3YMnLYWwAAAA="
```

The `Analytics` property is a gzipped, base64\-encoded, prefix\-encoded list of the constructs in the stack\.

To opt out of version reporting, use one of the following methods:
+ Use the cdk command with the \-\-no\-version\-reporting argument to opt out for a single command\.

  ```
  cdk --no-version-reporting synth
  ```

  Remember, the AWS CDK Toolkit synthesizes fresh templates before deploying, so you should also add `--no-version-reporting` to `cdk deploy` commands\.
+ Set versionReporting to **false** in `./cdk.json` or `~/.cdk.json`\. This opts out unless you opt in by specifying `--version-reporting` on an individual command\.

  ```
  {
    "app": "...",
    "versionReporting": false
  }
  ```

## Authentication with AWS<a name="cli_auth"></a>

 There are different ways in which you can configure programmatic access to AWS resources, depending on the environment and the AWS access available to you\. 

To choose your method of authentication and configure it for the CDK Toolkit, see [Authentication and access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access.html) in the *AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide*\. 

The recommended approach for new users developing locally, who are not given a method of authentication by their employer, is to set up AWS IAM Identity Center\. This method includes installing the AWS CLI for ease of configuration and for regularly signing in to the AWS access portal\. If you choose this method, your environment should contain the following elements after you complete the procedure for [IAM Identity Center authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access-sso.html) in the *AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide*:
+ The AWS CLI, which you use to start an AWS access portal session before you run your application\.
+ A [shared AWS`config` file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html) having a `[default]` profile with a set of configuration values that can be referenced from the AWS CDK\. To find the location of this file, see [Location of the shared files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-location.html) in the *AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide*\.
+  The shared `config` file sets the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-region.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-region.html) setting\. This sets the default AWS Region the AWS CDK and CDK Toolkit use for AWS requests\. 
+  The CDK Toolkit uses the profile's [SSO token provider configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-sso-credentials.html#feature-sso-credentials-profile) to acquire credentials before sending requests to AWS\. The `sso_role_name` value, which is an IAM role connected to an IAM Identity Center permission set, should allow access to the AWS services used in your application\.

  The following sample `config` file shows a default profile set up with SSO token provider configuration\. The profile's `sso_session` setting refers to the named [`sso-session` section](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html#section-session)\. The `sso-session` section contains settings to initiate an AWS access portal session\.

  ```
  [default]
  sso_session = my-sso
  sso_account_id = 111122223333
  sso_role_name = SampleRole
  region = us-east-1
  output = json
  
  [sso-session my-sso]
  sso_region = us-east-1
  sso_start_url = https://provided-domain.awsapps.com/start
  sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
  ```

### Start an AWS access portal session<a name="accessportal"></a>

Before accessing AWS services, you need an active AWS access portal session for the CDK Toolkit to use IAM Identity Center authentication to resolve credentials\. Depending on your configured session lengths, your access will eventually expire and the CDK Toolkit will encounter an authentication error\. Run the following command in the AWS CLI to sign in to the AWS access portal\.

```
aws sso login
```

 If your SSO token provider configuration is using a named profile instead of the default profile, the command is `aws sso login --profile NAME`\. Also specify this profile when issuing cdk commands using the \-\-profile option or the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable\.

To test if you already have an active session, run the following AWS CLI command\.

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

The response to this command should report the IAM Identity Center account and permission set configured in the shared `config` file\.

**Note**  
If you already have an active AWS access portal session and run `aws sso login`, you will not be required to provide credentials\.   
The sign in process may prompt you to allow the AWS CLI access to your data\. Since the AWS CLI is built on top of the SDK for Python, permission messages may contain variations of the `botocore` name\.

## Specifying Region and other configuration<a name="cli-environment"></a>

The CDK Toolkit needs to know the AWS Region that you're deploying into and how to authenticate with AWS\. This is needed for deployment operations and to retrieve context values during synthesis\. Together, your account and Region make up the *environment*\.

Region may be specified using environment variables or in configuration files\. These are the same variables and files used by other AWS tools such as the AWS CLI and the various AWS SDKs\. The CDK Toolkit looks for this information in the following order\.
+ The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable\.
+ A named profile defined in the standard AWS `config` file and specified using the `--profile` option on `cdk` commands\.
+ The `[default]` section of the standard AWS `config` file\.

Besides specifying AWS authentication and a Region in the `[default]` section, you can also add one or more `[profile NAME]` sections, where *NAME* is the name of the profile\. For more information about named profiles, see [Shared config and credentials files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html) in the *AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide*\.

The standard AWS `config` file is located at `~/.aws/config` \(macOS/Linux\) or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\config` \(Windows\)\. For details and alternate locations, see [Location of the shared config and credentials files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-location.html) in the *AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide*

The environment that you specify in your AWS CDK app by using the stack's `env` property is used during synthesis\. It's used to generate an environment\-specific AWS CloudFormation template, and during deployment, it overrides the account or Region specified by one of the preceding methods\. For more information, see [Environments](environments.md)\.

**Note**  
The AWS CDK uses credentials from the same source files as other AWS tools and SDKs, including the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)\. However, the AWS CDK might behave somewhat differently from these tools\. It uses the AWS SDK for JavaScript under the hood\. For complete details on setting up credentials for the AWS SDK for JavaScript, see [Setting credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials.html)\.

You may optionally use the `--role-arn` \(or `-r`\) option to specify the ARN of an IAM role that should be used for deployment\. This role must be assumable by the AWS account being used\.

## Specifying the app command<a name="cli-app-command"></a>

Many features of the CDK Toolkit require one or more AWS CloudFormation templates be synthesized, which in turn requires running your application\. The AWS CDK supports programs written in a variety of languages\. Therefore, it uses a configuration option to specify the exact command necessary to run your app\. This option can be specified in two ways\.

First, and most commonly, it can be specified using the `app` key inside the file `cdk.json`\. This is in the main directory of your AWS CDK project\. The CDK Toolkit provides an appropriate command when creating a new project with `cdk init`\. Here is the `cdk.json` from a fresh TypeScript project, for instance\.

```
{
  "app": "npx ts-node bin/hello-cdk.ts"
}
```

The CDK Toolkit looks for `cdk.json` in the current working directory when attempting to run your app\. Because of this, you might keep a shell open in your project's main directory for issuing CDK Toolkit commands\.

The CDK Toolkit also looks for the app key in `~/.cdk.json` \(that is, in your home directory\) if it can't find it in `./cdk.json`\. Adding the app command here can be useful if you usually work with CDK code in the same language\.

If you are in some other directory, or to run your app using a command other than the one in `cdk.json`, use the `--app` \(or `-a`\) option to specify it\.

```
cdk --app "npx ts-node bin/hello-cdk.ts" ls
```

When deploying, you may also specify a directory containing synthesized cloud assemblies, such as `cdk.out`, as the value of \-\-app\. The specified stacks are deployed from this directory; the app is not synthesized\.

## Specifying stacks<a name="cli-stacks"></a>

Many CDK Toolkit commands \(for example, `cdk deploy`\) work on stacks defined in your app\. If your app contains only one stack, the CDK Toolkit assumes you mean that one if you don't specify a stack explicitly\.

Otherwise, you must specify the stack or stacks you want to work with\. You can do this by specifying the desired stacks by ID individually on the command line\. Recall that the ID is the value specified by the second argument when you instantiate the stack\.

```
cdk synth PipelineStack LambdaStack
```

You may also use wildcards to specify IDs that match a pattern\.
+ `?` matches any single character
+ `*` matches any number of characters \(`*` alone matches all stacks\)
+ `**` matches everything in a hierarchy

You may also use the \-\-all option to specify all stacks\.

If your app uses [CDK Pipelines](cdk_pipeline.md), the CDK Toolkit understands your stacks and stages as a hierarchy\. Also, the \-\-all option and the `*` wildcard only match top\-level stacks\. To match all the stacks, use `**`\. Also use `**` to indicate all the stacks under a particular hierarchy\.

When using wildcards, enclose the pattern in quotes, or escape the wildcards with `\`\. If you don't, your shell may try to expand the pattern to the names of files in the current directory\. At best, this won't do what you expect; at worst, you could deploy stacks you didn't intend to\. This isn't strictly necessary on Windows because `cmd.exe` does not expand wildcards, but is good practice nonetheless\.

```
cdk synth "*Stack"    # PipelineStack, LambdaStack, etc.
cdk synth 'Stack?'    # StackA, StackB, Stack1, etc.
cdk synth \*          # All stacks in the app, or all top-level stacks in a CDK Pipelines app
cdk synth '**'        # All stacks in a CDK Pipelines app
cdk synth 'PipelineStack/Prod/**'   # All stacks in Prod stage in a CDK Pipelines app
```

**Note**  
The order in which you specify the stacks is not necessarily the order in which they will be processed\. The AWS CDK Toolkit accounts for dependencies between stacks when deciding the order in which to process them\. For example, let's say that one stack uses a value produced by another \(such as the ARN of a resource defined in the second stack\)\. In this case, the second stack is synthesized before the first one because of this dependency\. You can add dependencies between stacks manually using the stack's [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.Stack.html#addwbrdependencytarget-reason](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.Stack.html#addwbrdependencytarget-reason) method\.

## Bootstrapping your AWS environment<a name="cli-bootstrap"></a>

Deploying stacks with the CDK requires special dedicated AWS CDK resources to be provisioned\. The `cdk bootstrap` command creates the necessary resources for you\. You only need to bootstrap if you are deploying a stack that requires these dedicated resources\. See [Bootstrapping](bootstrapping.md) for details\.

```
cdk bootstrap
```

If issued with no arguments, as shown here, the `cdk bootstrap` command synthesizes the current app and bootstraps the environments its stacks will be deployed to\. If the app contains environment\-agnostic stacks, which don't explicitly specify an environment, the default account and Region are bootstrapped, or the environment specified using `--profile`\.

Outside of an app, you must explicitly specify the environment to be bootstrapped\. You may also do so to bootstrap an environment that's not specified in your app or local AWS profile\. Credentials must be configured \(e\.g\. in `~/.aws/credentials`\) for the specified account and Region\. You may specify a profile that contains the required credentials\.

```
cdk bootstrap ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION # e.g.
cdk bootstrap 1111111111/us-east-1
cdk bootstrap --profile test 1111111111/us-east-1
```

**Important**  
Each environment \(account/region combination\) to which you deploy such a stack must be bootstrapped separately\.

You may incur AWS charges for what the AWS CDK stores in the bootstrapped resources\. Additionally, if you use `-bootstrap-customer-key`, an AWS KMS key will be created, which also incurs charges per environment\.

**Note**  
Earlier versions of the bootstrap template created a KMS key by default\. To avoid charges, re\-bootstrap using `--no-bootstrap-customer-key`\. 

**Note**  
CDK Toolkit v2 does not support the original bootstrap template, dubbed the legacy template, used by default with CDK v1\.

**Important**  
The modern bootstrap template effectively grants the permissions implied by the `--cloudformation-execution-policies` to any AWS account in the `--trust` list\. By default, this extends permissions to read and write to any resource in the bootstrapped account\. Make sure to [configure the bootstrapping stack](bootstrapping.md#bootstrapping-customizing) with policies and trusted accounts that you are comfortable with\.

## Creating a new app<a name="cli-init"></a>

To create a new app, create a directory for it, then, inside the directory, issue `cdk init`\.

```
mkdir my-cdk-app
cd my-cdk-app
cdk init TEMPLATE --language LANGUAGE
```

The supported languages \(*LANGUAGE*\) are:


| Code | Language | 
| --- | --- | 
| `typescript` | TypeScript | 
| `javascript` | JavaScript | 
| `python` | Python | 
| `java` | Java | 
| `csharp` | C\# | 

*TEMPLATE* is an optional template\. If the desired template is *app*, the default, you may omit it\. The available templates are:


| Template | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| `app` \(default\) |  Creates an empty AWS CDK app\.  | 
| `sample-app` |  Creates an AWS CDK app with a stack containing an Amazon SQS queue and an Amazon SNS topic\.  | 

The templates use the name of the project folder to generate names for files and classes inside your new app\.

## Listing stacks<a name="cli-list"></a>

To see a list of the IDs of the stacks in your AWS CDK application, enter one of the following equivalent commands:

```
cdk list
cdk ls
```

If your application contains [CDK Pipelines](cdk_pipeline.md) stacks, the CDK Toolkit displays stack names as paths according to their location in the pipeline hierarchy\. \(For example, `PipelineStack`, `PipelineStack/Prod`, and `PipelineStack/Prod/MyService`\.\)

If your app contains many stacks, you can specify full or partial stack IDs of the stacks to be listed\. For more information, see [Specifying stacks](#cli-stacks)\.

Add the `--long` flag to see more information about the stacks, including the stack names and their environments \(AWS account and Region\)\.

## Synthesizing stacks<a name="cli-synth"></a>

The `cdk synthesize` command \(almost always abbreviated `synth`\) synthesizes a stack defined in your app into a CloudFormation template\.

```
cdk synth         # if app contains only one stack
cdk synth MyStack
cdk synth Stack1 Stack2
cdk synth "*"     # all stacks in app
```

**Note**  
The CDK Toolkit actually runs your app and synthesizes fresh templates before most operations \(such as when deploying or comparing stacks\)\. These templates are stored by default in the `cdk.out` directory\. The `cdk synth` command simply prints the generated templates for one or more specified stacks\.

See `cdk synth --help` for all available options\. A few of the most frequently used options are covered in the following section\.

### Specifying context values<a name="w95aac65b7c33c11"></a>

Use the `--context` or `-c` option to pass [runtime context](context.md) values to your CDK app\.

```
# specify a single context value
cdk synth --context key=value MyStack

# specify multiple context values (any number)
cdk synth --context key1=value1 --context key2=value2 MyStack
```

When deploying multiple stacks, the specified context values are normally passed to all of them\. If you want, you can specify different values for each stack by prefixing the stack name to the context value\.

```
# different context values for each stack
cdk synth --context Stack1:key=value Stack2:key=value Stack1 Stack2
```

### Specifying display format<a name="w95aac65b7c33c13"></a>

By default, the synthesized template is displayed in YAML format\. Add the `--json` flag to display it in JSON format instead\.

```
cdk synth --json MyStack
```

### Specifying output directory<a name="w95aac65b7c33c15"></a>

Add the `--output` \(`-o`\) option to write the synthesized templates to a directory other than `cdk.out`\.

```
cdk synth --output=~/templates
```

## Deploying stacks<a name="cli-deploy"></a>

The `cdk deploy` subcommand deploys one or more specified stacks to your AWS account\.

```
cdk deploy        # if app contains only one stack
cdk deploy MyStack
cdk deploy Stack1 Stack2
cdk deploy "*"    # all stacks in app
```

**Note**  
The CDK Toolkit runs your app and synthesizes fresh AWS CloudFormation templates before deploying anything\. Therefore, most command line options you can use with `cdk synth` \(for example, `--context`\) can also be used with `cdk deploy`\.

See `cdk deploy --help` for all available options\. A few of the most useful options are covered in the following section\.

### Skipping synthesis<a name="cli-deploy-nosynth"></a>

The cdk deploy command normally synthesizes your app's stacks before deploying to make sure that the deployment reflects the latest version of your app\. If you know that you haven't changed your code since your last cdk synth, you can suppress the redundant synthesis step when deploying\. To do so, specify your project's `cdk.out` directory in the \-\-app option\.

```
cdk deploy --app cdk.out StackOne StackTwo
```

### Disabling rollback<a name="cli-deploy-norollback"></a>

AWS CloudFormation has the ability to roll back changes so that deployments are atomic\. This means that they either succeed or fail as a whole\. The AWS CDK inherits this capability because it synthesizes and deploys AWS CloudFormation templates\. 

Rollback makes sure that your resources are in a consistent state at all times, which is vital for production stacks\. However, while you're still developing your infrastructure, some failures are inevitable, and rolling back failed deployments can slow you down\.

For this reason, the CDK Toolkit lets you disable rollback by adding `--no-rollback` to your `cdk deploy` command\. With this flag, failed deployments are not rolled back\. Instead, resources deployed before the failed resource remain in place, and the next deployment starts with the failed resource\. You'll spend a lot less time waiting for deployments and a lot more time developing your infrastructure\.

### Hot swapping<a name="cli-deploy-hotswap"></a>

Use the `--hotswap` flag with `cdk deploy` to attempt to update your AWS resources directly instead of generating an AWS CloudFormation change set and deploying it\. Deployment falls back to AWS CloudFormation deployment if hot swapping is not possible\.

Currently hot swapping supports Lambda functions, Step Functions state machines, and Amazon ECS container images\. The `--hotswap` flag also disables rollback \(i\.e\., implies `--no-rollback`\)\.

**Important**  
Hot\-swapping is not recommended for production deployments\.

### Watch mode<a name="cli-deploy-watch"></a>

The CDK Toolkit's watch mode \( cdk deploy \-\-watch, or cdk watch for short\) continuously monitors your CDK app's source files and assets for changes\. It immediately performs a deployment of the specified stacks when a change is detected\.

By default, these deployments use the `--hotswap` flag, which fast\-tracks deployment of changes to Lambda functions\. It also falls back to deploying through AWS CloudFormation if you have changed infrastructure configuration\. To have `cdk watch` always perform full AWS CloudFormation deployments, add the `--no-hotswap` flag to `cdk watch`\.

Any changes made while `cdk watch` is already performing a deployment are combined into a single deployment, which begins as soon as the in\-progress deployment is complete\.

Watch mode uses the `"watch"` key in the project's `cdk.json` to determine which files to monitor\. By default, these files are your application files and assets, but this can be changed by modifying the `"include"` and `"exclude"` entries in the `"watch"` key\. The following `cdk.json` file shows an example of these entries\.

```
{
  "app": "mvn -e -q compile exec:java",
  "watch": {
    "include": "src/main/**",
    "exclude": "target/*"
  }
}
```

`cdk watch` executes the `"build"` command from `cdk.json` to build your app before synthesis\. If your deployment requires any commands to build or package your Lambda code \(or anything else that's not in your CDK app\), add it here\.

Git\-style wildcards, both `*` and `**`, can be used in the `"watch"` and `"build"` keys\. Each path is interpreted relative to the parent directory of `cdk.json`\. The default value of `include` is `**/*`, meaning all files and directories in the project root directory\. `exclude` is optional\.

**Important**  
Watch mode is not recommended for production deployments\.

### Specifying AWS CloudFormation parameters<a name="w95aac65b7c35c19"></a>

The AWS CDK Toolkit supports specifying AWS CloudFormation [parameters](parameters.md) at deployment\. You may provide these on the command line following the `--parameters` flag\.

```
cdk deploy MyStack --parameters uploadBucketName=UploadBucket
```

To define multiple parameters, use multiple `--parameters` flags\.

```
cdk deploy MyStack --parameters uploadBucketName=UpBucket --parameters downloadBucketName=DownBucket
```

If you are deploying multiple stacks, you can specify a different value of each parameter for each stack\. To do so, prefix the name of the parameter with the stack name and a colon\. Otherwise, the same value is passed to all stacks\.

```
cdk deploy MyStack YourStack --parameters MyStack:uploadBucketName=UploadBucket --parameters YourStack:uploadBucketName=UpBucket
```

By default, the AWS CDK retains values of parameters from previous deployments and uses them in later deployments if they are not specified explicitly\. Use the `--no-previous-parameters` flag to require all parameters to be specified\.

### Specifying outputs file<a name="w95aac65b7c35c21"></a>

If your stack declares AWS CloudFormation outputs, these are normally displayed on the screen at the conclusion of deployment\. To write them to a file in JSON format, use the `--outputs-file` flag\.

```
cdk deploy --outputs-file outputs.json MyStack
```

### Security\-related changes<a name="cli-security"></a>

To protect you against unintended changes that affect your security posture, the AWS CDK Toolkit prompts you to approve security\-related changes before deploying them\. You can specify the level of change that requires approval:

```
cdk deploy --require-approval LEVEL
```

*LEVEL* can be one of the following:


| Term | Meaning | 
| --- | --- | 
| `never` | Approval is never required | 
| `any-change` | Requires approval on any IAM or security\-group\-related change | 
| `broadening` \(default\) | Requires approval when IAM statements or traffic rules are added; removals don't require approval | 

The setting can also be configured in the `cdk.json` file\.

```
{
  "app": "...",
  "requireApproval": "never"
}
```

## Comparing stacks<a name="cli-diff"></a>

The `cdk diff` command compares the current version of a stack \(and its dependencies\) defined in your app with the already\-deployed versions, or with a saved AWS CloudFormation template, and displays a list of changes\.

```

To compare your app's stacks with the existing deployment:

```
cdk diff MyStack
```

To compare your app's stacks with a saved CloudFormation template:

```
cdk diff --template ~/stacks/MyStack.old MyStack
```

## Importing existing resources into a stack<a name="cli-import"></a>

You can use the `cdk import` command to bring resources under the management of CloudFormation for a particular AWS CDK stack\. This is useful if you are migrating to AWS CDK, or are moving resources between stacks or changing their logical id\. `cdk import` uses [ CloudFormation resource imports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import.html)\. See the [list of resources that can be imported here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html)\. 

To import an existing resource into a AWS CDK stack, follow the following steps:
+ Make sure the resource is not currently being managed by any other CloudFormation stack\. If it is, first set the removal policy to `RemovalPolicy.RETAIN` in the stack the resource is currently in and perform a deployment\. Then, remove the resource from the stack and perform another deployment\. This process will make sure that the resource is no longer managed by CloudFormation but does not delete it\.
+ Run a `cdk diff` to make sure there are no pending changes to the AWS CDK stack you want to import resources into\. The only changes allowed in an "import" operation are the addition of new resources which you want to import\.
+ Add constructs for the resources you want to import to your stack\. For example, if you want to import an Amazon S3 bucket, add something like `new s3.Bucket(this, 'ImportedS3Bucket', {});`\. Do not make any modifications to any other resource\.

  You must also make sure to exactly model the state that the resource currently has into the definition\. For the example of the bucket, be sure to include AWS KMS keys, life cycle policies, and anything else that's relevant about the bucket\. If you do not, subsequent update operations may not do what you expect\.

  You can choose whether or not to include the physical bucket name\. We usually recommend to not include resource names into your AWS CDK resource definitions so that it becomes easier to deploy your resources multiple times\.
+ Run `cdk import STACKNAME`\.
+ If the resource names are not in your model, the CLI will prompt you to pass in the actual names of the resources you are importing\. After this, the import starts\.
+ When `cdk import` reports success, the resource is now managed by AWS CDK and CloudFormation\. Any subsequent changes you make to the resource properties in your AWS CDK app the construct configuration will be applied on the next deployment\.
+ To confirm that the resource definition in your AWS CDK app matches the current state of the resource, you can start an [CloudFormation drift detection operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html)\.

This feature currently does not support importing resources into nested stacks\.

## Configuration \(`cdk.json`\)<a name="cli-config"></a>

Default values for many CDK Toolkit command line flags can be stored in a project's `cdk.json` file or in the `.cdk.json` file in your user directory\. Following is an alphabetical reference to the supported configuration settings\.
