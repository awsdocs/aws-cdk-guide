# Migrating to AWS CDK v2<a name="migrating-v2"></a>

Version 2 of the AWS Cloud Development Kit \(AWS CDK\) is designed to make writing infrastructure as code in your preferred programming language even easier\. This topic describes the changes between v1 and v2 of the AWS CDK\.

**Tip**  
To identify stacks deployed with AWS CDK v1, use the [awscdk\-v1\-stack\-finder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/awscdk-v1-stack-finder) utility\.

The main changes from AWS CDK v1 to CDK v2 are as follows\.
+ AWS CDK v2 consolidates the stable parts of the AWS Construct Library, including the core library, into a single package, `aws-cdk-lib`\. Developers no longer need to install additional packages for the individual AWS services they use\. This single\-package approach also eliminates the need to synchronize the versions of the various CDK library packages\.

  L1 \(CfnXXXX\) constructs, which represent the exact resources available in AWS CloudFormation, are always considered stable and so are included in `aws-cdk-lib`\.
+ Experimental modules, where we're still working with the community to develop new [L2 or L3 constructs](constructs.md#constructs_lib), are not included in `aws-cdk-lib`; they are instead distributed as individual packages\. Experimental packages are named with an `alpha` suffix and a semantic version number that matches the first version of the AWS Construct Library with which they are compatible, also with an `alpha` suffix\. Constructs move into `aws-cdk-lib` after being designated stable, permitting the main Construct Library to adhere to strict semantic versioning\. 

  Stability is specified at the service level\. For example, if we begin creating one or more [L2 constructs](constructs.md#constructs_lib) for Amazon AppFlow, which at this writing has only L1 constructs, they would first appear in a module named `@aws-cdk/aws-appflow-alpha`, then move to `aws-cdk-lib` when we feel the new constructs meet the fundamental needs of customers\.

  Once a module has been designated stable and incorporated into `aws-cdk-lib`, new APIs are added using the "BetaN" convention described in the next bullet\. 

  A new version of each experimental module is released with every release of the AWS CDK, but for the most part, they needn't be kept in sync\. You can upgrade `aws-cdk-lib` or the experimental module whenever you want\. The exception is that when two or more related experimental modules depend on each other, they must be the same version\.
+ For stable modules to which new functionality is being added, new APIs \(whether entirely new constructs or new methods or properties on an existing construct\) receive a `Beta1` suffix \(and then `Beta2`, `Beta3`, etc\. when breaking changes are needed\) while work is in progress\. A version of the API without the suffix is added when the API is designated stable\. All methods except the latest \(whether beta or final\) are then deprecated\.

  For example, if we add a new method `grantPower()` to a construct, it initially appears as `grantPowerBeta1().` If breaking changes are needed \(for example, a new required parameter or property\), the next version of the method would be named `grantPowerBeta2()`, and so on\. When work is complete and the API is finalized, the method `grantPower()` \(with no suffix\) is added, and the BetaN methods are deprecated\.

  All the beta APIs remain in the Construct Library until the next major version \(3\.0\) release, and their signatures will not change\. You'll see deprecation warnings if you use them, so you should move to the final version of the API at your earliest convenience, but a future AWS CDK 2\.x release will not break your application\.
+ The `Construct` class has been extracted from the AWS CDK into a separate library, along with related types, to support efforts to apply the Construct Programming Model to other domains\. If you are writing your own constructs or using related APIs, you must declare the `constructs` module as a dependency and make minor changes to your imports\. If you are using advanced features, such as hooking into the CDK app lifecycle, more changes may be needed\. [See the RFC](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/blob/master/text/0192-remove-constructs-compat.md#release-notes) for full details\.
+ Deprecated properties, methods, and types in AWS CDK v1\.x and its Construct Library have been removed completely from the CDK v2 API\. In most supported languages, these APIs produce warnings under v1\.x, so you may have already migrated to the replacement APIs\. A complete [list of deprecated APIs](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/DEPRECATED_APIs.md) in CDK v1\.x is available on GitHub\.
+ Behavior that was gated by feature flags in AWS CDK v1\.x is enabled by default in CDK v2, and the old feature flags are no longer needed or, in most cases, supported\. A handful are still available to let you to revert to CDK v1 behavior in very specific circumstances; see [Updating feature flags](#migrating-v2-v1-upgrade-cdk-json)\.
+ CDK v2 requires that the environments you deploy into be bootstrapped using the modern bootstrap stack; the legacy bootstrap stack \(the default under v1\) is no longer supported\. CDK v2 furthermore requires a new version of the modern stack\. Simply re\-bootstrap your existing environments to upgrade them\. It is no longer necessary to set any feature flags or environment variables to specify the modern bootstrap stack\.

**Important**  
The modern bootstrap template effectively grants the permissions implied by the `--cloudformation-execution-policies` to any AWS account in the `--trust` list, which by default will extend permissions to read and write to any resource in the bootstrapped account\. Make sure to [configure the bootstrapping stack](bootstrapping.md#bootstrapping-customizing) with policies and trusted accounts you are comfortable with\.

## New prerequisites<a name="migrating-v2-prerequisites"></a>

Most requirements for AWS CDK v2 are the same as for AWS CDK v1\.x\. Additional requirements are listed here\.
+ For TypeScript developers, TypeScript 3\.8 or later is required\.
+ A new version of the CDK Toolkit is required for use with CDK v2\. Now that CDK v2 is Generally Available, v2 is the default version when installing the CDK Toolkit\. It is backward\-compatible with CDK v1 projects, so you do not need to keep the old version installed unless you want to create CDK v1 projects\. To upgrade, issue `npm install -g aws-cdk`\.

## Upgrading from AWS CDK v2 Developer Preview<a name="migrating-v2-dp-upgrade"></a>

If you have been using the CDK v2 Developer Preview, you have dependencies in your project on a Release Candidate version of the AWS CDK, such as `2.0.0-rc1`\. Update these to `2.0.0`, then update the modules installed in your project\.

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

`npm install` or `yarn install`

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

`npm install` or `yarn install`

------
#### [ Python ]

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

------
#### [ Java ]

```
mvn package
```

------
#### [ C\# ]

```
dotnet restore
```

------

After updating your dependencies, issue `npm update -g aws-cdk` to update the CDK Toolkit to the release version\.

## Migrating from AWS CDK v1 to CDK v2<a name="migrating-v2-v1-uppgrade"></a>

To migrate your app to AWS CDK v2, first update the feature flags in `cdk.json`\. Then update your app's dependencies and imports as necessary for the programming language it is written in\.

### Updating feature flags<a name="migrating-v2-v1-upgrade-cdk-json"></a>

Remove all feature flags from `cdk.json`\. You can add one or more of the flags listed below, set to `false`, if your app relies on these specific AWS CDK v1 behaviors\. Use the `cdk diff` command to inspect the changes to your synthesized template to see if any of these flags are needed\.

`@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway:usagePlanKeyOrderInsensitiveId`  
If your application uses multiple Amazon API Gateway API keys and associates them to usage plans

`@aws-cdk/aws-rds:lowercaseDbIdentifier`  
If your application uses Amazon RDS database instance or database clusters, and explicitly specifies the identifier for these

`@aws-cdk/aws-cloudfront:defaultSecurityPolicyTLSv1.2_2021`  
 If your application uses the TLS\_V1\_2\_2019 security policy with Amazon CloudFront distributions\. CDK v2 uses security policy TLSv1\.2\_2021 by default\. 

`@aws-cdk/core:stackRelativeExports`  
If your application uses multiple stacks and you refer to resources from one stack in another, this determines whether absolute or relative path is used to construct AWS CloudFormation exports

The syntax for reverting these flags in `cdk.json` is shown here\.

```
{
  "context": {
    "@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway:usagePlanKeyOrderInsensitiveId": false,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-cloudfront:defaultSecurityPolicyTLSv1.2_2021": false,
    "@aws-cdk/aws-rds:lowercaseDbIdentifier": false,
    "@aws-cdk/core:stackRelativeExports": false
  }
}
```

### CDK Toolkit compatibility<a name="work-with-cdk-v2-cli"></a>

CDK v2 requires v2 or later of the CDK Toolkit\. This version is backward\-compatible with CDK v1 apps, so you can use a single globally\-installed version of CDK Toolkit with all your AWS CDK projects, whether they use v1 or v2\. An exception is that CDK Toolkit v2 creates CDK v2 projects\.

If you need to create both v1 and v2 CDK projects, **do not install CDK Toolkit v2 globally\.** \(Remove it if you already have it installed: `npm remove -g aws-cdk`\.\) To invoke the CDK Toolkit, use npx to run v1 or v2 of the CDK Toolkit as desired\.

```
npx aws-cdk@1.x init app --language typescript
npx aws-cdk@2.x init app --language typescript
```

**Tip**  
Set up command line aliases so you can use the cdk and cdk1 commands to invoke the desired version of the CDK Toolkit\.  

```
alias cdk1="npx aws-cdk@1.x"
alias cdk="npx aws-cdk@2.x"
```

```
doskey cdk1=npx aws-cdk@1.x $*
doskey cdk=npx aws-cdk@2.x $*
```

### Updating dependencies and imports<a name="migrating-v2-v1-upgrade-dependencies"></a>

Update your app's dependencies, then install the new packages\. Finally, update the imports in your code\.

------
#### [ TypeScript ]

**Applications**  
For CDK apps, update `package.json` as follows\. Remove dependencies on v1\-style individual stable modules and establish the lowest version of `aws-cdk-lib` you require for your application \(2\.0\.0 here\)\.

Experimental constructs are provided in separate, independently\-versioned packages with names that end in `alpha` and an alpha version number that corresponds to the first release of `aws-cdk-lib` with which they are compatible\. Here we have pinned `aws-codestar` to v2\.0\.0\-alpha\.1\.

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "aws-cdk-lib": "^2.0.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-codestar-alpha": "2.0.0-alpha.1",
    "constructs": "^10.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Construct libraries**  
For construct libraries, establish the lowest version of `aws-cdk-lib` you require for your application \(2\.0\.0 here\) and update `package.json` as follows\.

Note that `aws-cdk-lib` appears both as a peer dependency and a dev dependency\.

```
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "aws-cdk-lib": "^2.0.0",
    "constructs": "^10.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "aws-cdk-lib": "^2.0.0",
    "constructs": "^10.0.0",
    "typescript": "~3.9.0"
  }  
}
```

**Note**  
You should perform a major version bump on your library's version number when releasing a v2\-compatible library, as this will be a breaking change for consumers of the library\. It is not possible to support both CDK v1 and v2 with a single library\. To continue to support customers who are still using v1, you could maintain the older release in parallel, or create a new package for v2\.  
It's up to you how long you want to continue supporting AWS CDK v1 customers, but you could take your cue from the lifecycle of CDK v1 itself, which entered maintenance on June 1, 2022 and will reach end\-of\-life on June 1, 2023\. For full details, see [AWS CDK Maintenance Policy](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/blob/master/text/0079-cdk-2.0.md#aws-cdk-maintenance-policy)

**Both libraries and apps**  
Install the new dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`\.

Change your imports to import `Construct` from the new `constructs` module, core types such as `App` and `Stack` from the top level of `aws-cdk-lib`, and stable Construct Library modules for the services you use from namespaces under `aws-cdk-lib`\.

```
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Stack } from 'aws-cdk-lib';                 // core constructs
import { aws_s3 as s3 } from 'aws-cdk-lib';               // stable module
import * as codestar from '@aws-cdk/aws-codestar-alpha';  // experimental module
```

------
#### [ JavaScript ]

Update `package.json` as follows\. Remove dependencies on v1\-style individual stable modules and establish the lowest version of `aws-cdk-lib` you require for your application \(2\.0\.0 here\)\.

Experimental constructs are provided in separate, independently\-versioned packages with names that end in `alpha` and an alpha version number that corresponds to the first release of `aws-cdk-lib` with which they are compatible\. Here we have pinned `aws-codestar` to v2\.0\.0\-alpha\.1\.

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "aws-cdk-lib": "^2.0.0",
    "@aws-cdk/aws-codestar-alpha": "2.0.0-alpha.1",
    "constructs": "^10.0.0"
  }
}
```

Install the new dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`\.

Change your app's imports to import `Construct` from the new `constructs` module, core types such as `App` and `Stack` from the top level of `aws-cdk-lib`, and AWS Construct Library modules from namespaces under `aws-cdk-lib`\.

```
const { Construct } = require('constructs');
const { App, Stack } = require('aws-cdk-lib');              // core constructs
const s3 = require('aws-cdk-lib').aws_s3;                   // stable module
const codestar = require('@aws-cdk/aws-codestar-alpha');    // experimental module
```

------
#### [ Python ]

Update `requirements.txt` or the `install_requires` definition in `setup.py` as follows\. Remove dependencies on v1\-style individual stable modules\.

Experimental constructs are provided in separate, independently\-versioned packages with names that end in `alpha` and an alpha version number that corresponds to the first release of `aws-cdk-lib` wit which they are compatible\. Here we have pinned `aws-codestar` to v2\.0\.0alpha1\.

```
install_requires=[
     "aws-cdk-lib>=2.0.0",
     "constructs>=10.0.0",
     "aws-cdk.aws-codestar-alpha>=2.0.0alpha1",
     # ...
],
```

**Tip**  
Uninstall any other versions of AWS CDK modules already installed in your app's virtual environment using `pip uninstall`\. Then Install the new dependencies with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\. 

Change your app's imports to import `Construct` from the new `constructs` module, core types such as `App` and `Stack` from the top level of `aws_cdk`, and AWS Construct Library modules from namespaces under `aws_cdk`\.

```
from constructs import Construct
from aws_cdk import App, Stack                    # core constructs
from aws_cdk import aws_s3 as s3                  # stable module
import aws_cdk.aws_codestar_alpha as codestar     # experimental module

# ...

class MyConstruct(Construct):
    # ...
    
class MyStack(Stack):
    # ...
    
s3.Bucket(...)
```

------
#### [ Java ]

In `pom.xml`, remove all `software.amazon.awscdk` dependencies for stable modules and replace them with dependencies on `software.constructs` \(for `Construct`\) and `software.amazon.awscdk`\.

Experimental constructs are provided in separate, independently\-versioned packages with names that end in `alpha` and an alpha version number that corresponds to the first release of `aws-cdk-lib` wit which they are compatible\. Here we have pinned `aws-codestar` to v2\.0\.0\-alpha\.1\.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.awscdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>aws-cdk-lib</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency><dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.awscdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>code-star-alpha</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0-alpha.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>software.constructs</groupId>
    <artifactId>constructs</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Install the new dependencies by running `mvn package`\.

Change your code to import `Construct` from the new `software.constructs` library, core classes like `Stack` and `App` from `software.amazon.awscdk`, and service constructs from `software.amazon.awscdk.services`\.

```
import software.constructs.Construct;
import software.amazon.awscdk.Stack;
import software.amazon.awscdk.StackProps;
import software.amazon.awscdk.App;
import software.amazon.awscdk.services.s3.Bucket;
import software.amazon.awscdk.services.codestar.alpha.GitHubRepository;
```

------
#### [ C\# ]

The most straightforward way to upgrade the dependencies of a C\# CDK application is to edit the `.csproj` file manually\. Remove all stable `Amazon.CDK.*` package references and replace them with references to the `Amazon.CDK.Lib` and `Constructs` packages\.

Experimental constructs are provided in separate, independently\-versioned packages with names that end in `alpha` and an alpha version number that corresponds to the first release of `aws-cdk-lib` with which they are compatible\. Here we have pinned `aws-codestar` to v2\.0\.0\-alpha\.1\.

```
<PackageReference Include="Amazon.CDK.Lib" Version="2.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Amazon.CDK.AWS.Codestar.Alpha" Version="2.0.0-alpha.1" />
<PackageReference Include="Constructs" Version="10.0.0" />
```

Install the new dependencies by running `dotnet restore`\.

Change the imports in your source files as follows\.

```
using Constructs;                   // for Construct class
using Amazon.CDK;                   // for core classes like App and Stack
using Amazon.CDK.AWS.S3;            // for stable constructs like Bucket
using Amazon.CDK.Codestar.Alpha;    // for experimental constructs
```

## Testing your migrated app before deploying<a name="migrating-v2-diff.title"></a>

Before deploying your stacks, use `cdk diff` to check for unexpected changes to the resources\. Changes to logical IDs \(causing replacement of resources\) are **not** expected\.

Expected changes include but are not limited to:
+ Changes to the `CDKMetadata` resource
+ Updated asset hashes
+ Changes related to the new\-style stack synthesis, if your app used the legacy stack synthesizer in v1 \(CDK v2 does not support the legacy stack synthesizer\)
+ The addition of a `CheckBootstrapVersion` rule

Unexpected changes are typically not caused by upgrading to AWS CDK v2 in itself, but are usually the result of deprecated behavior that was previously changed by feature flags\. This is a symptom of upgrading from a version of CDK older than about 1\.85\.x; you'd see the same changes upgrading to the latest v1\.x release\. You can usually resolve this by upgrading your app to the latest v1\.x release, removing feature flags, revising your code as necessary, deploying, and then upgrading to v2\.

**Note**  
If your upgraded app ends up undeployable after the two\-stage upgrade, please [report the issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/new/choose)\.

When you are ready to deploy the stacks in your app, consider deploying a copy first so you can test it\. The easiest way to do this is to deploy it into a different region\. However, you can also simply change the IDs of your stack\(s\)\. After testing, be sure to destroy the testing copy with cdk destroy\.

## Troubleshooting<a name="migrating-v2-trouble.title"></a>

**Typescript `'from' expected` or `';' expected` error in imports**  
Upgrade to TypeScript 3\.8 or later\.

**Please run 'cdk bootstrap'**  
If you see an error like this one:

```
❌  MyStack failed: Error: MyStack: SSM parameter /cdk-bootstrap/hnb659fds/version not found. Has the environment been bootstrapped? Please run 'cdk bootstrap' (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html)
    at CloudFormationDeployments.validateBootstrapStackVersion (.../aws-cdk/lib/api/cloudformation-deployments.ts:323:13)
    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:97:5)
MyStack: SSM parameter /cdk-bootstrap/hnb659fds/version not found. Has the environment been bootstrapped? Please run 'cdk bootstrap' (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html)
```

AWS CDK v2 requires an updated bootstrap stack, and furthermore, all v2 deployments require bootstrap resources \(v1 allowed you to deploy simple stacks without having bootstrapped\)\. See [Bootstrapping](bootstrapping.md) for complete details\.

## Finding v1 stacks<a name="finding-v1-stacks.title"></a>

When migrating your CDK application from v1 to v2, you might want to identify the deployed AWS CloudFormation stacks that were created using v1\. To do this, run the following command: 

```
npx awscdk-v1-stack-finder
```

See the awscdk\-v1\-stack\-finder [README](https://github.com/cdklabs/awscdk-v1-stack-finder/blob/main/README.md) for usage details\.
