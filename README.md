# Welcome to the AWS CDK Developer Guide

This is the GitHub repository for the [AWS CDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).
You're welcome to [report issues](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-cdk-guide/issues/new) with the documentation here or, if you have a moment, to submit a Pull Request with your suggested changes. PRs should target the main branch, not master, which has been deprecated.

* `v2` - contains the Markdown files for the CDK v2 Developer Guide

Feel free to make a Pull Request against only one of these content sets (we'll make sure it gets into both).

Issues reported through the Feedback link at the bottom of the individual pages of the AWS CDK Developer Guide go to an internal Amazon issue tracker and may not appear here. However, we try to track most substantive AWS CDK Developer Guide work on GitHub 
so the community can see, comment, and contribute.
